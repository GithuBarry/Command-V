((-1 + 2 + 9 * 5) - (-2 + -4 + -4 * -7))","{""ANSWER"": INTEGER}",,"Let's solve this step by step.

The given expression is:

(-1 + 2 + 9 * 5) - (-2 + -4 + -4 * -7)

First, I need to handle the multiplication inside the parentheses.

For the first part (-1 + 2 + 9 * 5):
- The multiplication here is 9 * 5 = 45.
- So, the expression becomes (-1 + 2 + 45).

Now, let's simplify the first part:
-1 + 2 + 45 = 1 + 45 = 46.

So the first part simplifies to 46.

Next, let's simplify the second part (-2 + -4 + -4 * -7):
- Again, we have multiplication -4 * -7 = 28 (since a negative times a negative gives a positive).
- Now the expression is (-2 + -4 + 28).

Simplifying the second part:
-2 + -4 + 28 = -6 + 28 = 22.

So the second part simplifies to 22.

Now we subtract the simplified second part from the first part:
46 - 22 = 24.

Since the question asks for an integer answer and all operations involved integers, the final answer is indeed an integer. 

So the answer is {""ANSWER"": $INTEGER}. But since it's just a number, the correct format should be {""ANSWER"": 24}.

((-9 * -5 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - -6 * -3 * 1))","{""ANSWER"": INTEGER}",,"Let's solve this step by step.

The expression is:

((-9 * -5 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - -6 * -3 * 1))

First, let's handle the multiplication and addition/subtraction inside the parentheses.

Step 1: Calculate -9 * -5.
-9 times -5 equals 45 (because negative times negative gives positive).

So, the expression now looks like:
((45 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - -6 * -3 * 1))

Step 2: Perform the subtraction and addition within the first set of parentheses.
45 minus 6 equals 39.
39 plus -2 (which is the same as subtracting 2) equals 37.

Now the expression simplifies to:
(37 - (-8 - -6 * -3 * 1))

Next, we need to calculate the part in the second set of parentheses: -8 minus -6 times -3 times 1.

Step 3: Calculate -6 times -3.
Negative six times negative three equals 18.

Step 4: Multiply the result by 1 (since multiplying any number by 1 doesn't change it).
So, -6 times -3 equals 18.

Step 5: Now we have -8 minus 18.
-8 minus 18 equals -26.

So the expression simplifies further to:
(37 - (-26))

Finally, subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart.
37 plus 26 equals 63.

Therefore, the final answer is 63.

Starting with the first part inside the parentheses: 3 * -3 * 6 + -5.

First, calculate 3 * -3:
3 * -3 = -9

Then multiply that result by 6:
-9 * 6 = -54

Now add -5:
-54 + -5 = -59

So far, we have: ((-59) - (-2 + -7 - 7 - -7))

Next, let's simplify the second part in parentheses: -2 + -7 - 7 - -7.

First, handle the double negative: -(-7) is the same as +7.
So, -2 + -7 - 7 + 7.

Simplifying this:

-2 - 7 = -9
-9 - 7 = -16
-16 + 7 = -9

So, -2 + -7 - 7 - -7 simplifies to -9.

Now we have: ((-59) - (-9))

Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive:
-59 + 9 = -50

So the final answer is -50. The integer form of -50 is just -50, which can be represented as an integer. Therefore, the answer is {""ANSWER"": -50} or simply {""ANSWER"": $INTEGER}.",,2025-05-10 23:22:54

First, let me simplify the inner part of the expression: (-1 * 7 * -6 + -2). I'll start with the multiplication and addition inside that.

(-1 * 7 * -6): First, multiply -1 and 7 which gives -7. Then multiply -7 by -6, which equals 42 (since negative times negative is positive).

So now we have (-42 + -2), which simplifies to -44. 

Now, I need to substitute this back into the original expression, so it becomes ((6 * -6 * 8 * 1) * (-44)).

Next, let's simplify the product inside the parentheses: (6 * -6 * 8 * 1).

6 * -6 = -36 (negative times positive is negative).

-36 * 8 = -288 (negative times positive is negative).

Finally, multiply -288 by -44:

-288 * -44 = 12528.

So, the final result is 12528, which is an integer.

First, let's break down the expression into two parts and simplify each part separately:

Part 1: (-6 - (-4) + 9 + 0)
- The first term is negative six.
- The second term is minus negative four, which simplifies to positive four.
- The third term is nine.
- The fourth term is zero.

So, we have:
(-6 + 4 + 9 + 0)

Now, let's add these numbers together:
-6 + 4 = -2
-2 + 9 = 7
7 + 0 = 7

Part 1 simplifies to 7.

Next, let's look at the second part of the expression:
(1 + (-4) - (-9) * 6)

First, simplify the multiplication:
-9 * 6 = -54

Now, substitute back into the expression:
(1 - 4 + 54)

Let's simplify this:
1 - 4 = -3
-3 + 54 = 51

So, the second part simplifies to 51.

Finally, add the results from both parts:
Part 1 (7) + Part 2 (51) = 7 + 51 = 58

First, let's look at the left part of the expression: (-6 - 4 * 2 - 6).

1. Inside the parentheses, there's multiplication first, then subtraction.
   -4 * 2 = -8
   So, the expression becomes (-6 - 8 - 6).
   
2. Now, perform the subtractions from left to right:
   -6 - 8 = -14
   -14 - 6 = -20

So, the left part simplifies to -20.

Now, let's handle the right part of the expression: (1 + -2 * 1 * 7).

1. Again, multiplication comes before addition.
   -2 * 1 = -2
   -2 * 7 = -14
   So, the expression becomes (1 - 14).
   
2. Perform the addition/subtraction:
   1 - 14 = -13

So, the right part simplifies to -13.

Now we have the full expression: (-20 + -13).

Finally, add these two results together:

Starting with (1 - 0 + 1 - 4):
1 minus 0 gives 1.
Adding 1 to that is 1 + 1 = 2.
Then subtracting 4 from 2 gives 2 - 4 = -2.

Now, let's simplify the second part of the expression: (-3 * 1 - -6 * -8).

First, calculate -3 * 1:
-3 times 1 is -3.

Next, calculate -6 * -8:
The product of two negative numbers is positive, so -6 * -8 equals 48.

So the expression becomes: (-3 - 48).

Now, add -3 and -48:
-3 plus -48 is -51.

Putting it all together, we have (-2) - (-51). Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding the positive counterpart, so:

(-2) - (-51) = -2 + 51 = 49.

The final answer is 49, which is an integer. So the correct response is {""ANSWER"": $INTEGER}. 

I believe my steps are correct, but let me double-check just in case. Let me run through it again quickly:

1. Simplify (1 - 0 + 1 - 4) = -2.
2. Simplify (-3 * 1 - -6 * -8) = -3 - 48 = -51.

The expression given is:

((1 + 7 * -9 + -5) + (3 + -5 * 2 - 6))

First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). Since there are no exponents in this problem, we can skip that part.

Starting with the first set of parentheses:

1. Inside (1 + 7 * -9 + -5):
   - First, do the multiplication: 7 * -9 = -63.
   - So, it becomes (1 + -63 + -5).
   - Next, add these numbers: 1 - 63 - 5 = 1 - 68 = -67.

Now, let's move to the second set of parentheses:

2. Inside (3 + -5 * 2 - 6):
   - Again, do the multiplication: -5 * 2 = -10.
   - So, it becomes (3 + -10 - 6).

-7 multiplied by -9 gives 63 (because negative times negative is positive).
8 multiplied by -3 equals -24.
So, 63 + (-24) = 63 - 24 = 39.

Now for the second part (5 + -7 - 4 * -5):
5 minus 7 equals -2.
Then, -4 multiplied by -5 equals 20 (negative times negative is positive).

   -1 * -7 = 7

First, let's look at the inner parentheses in the first part of the expression: (6 - 0 * 5 + -3). Inside these parentheses, we have multiplication before addition and subtraction. So, we'll start with 0 * 5, which equals 0. Now the expression inside the first set of parentheses becomes (6 - 0 + -3).

Now, simplifying that: 6 - 0 = 6, and then 6 - 3 = 3. So, the first part of the expression simplifies to 3.

Next, let's look at the second part of the original expression: (6 - -7 + -2 - -7). Again, we have multiplication and addition/subtraction. Let's handle the multiplication first, but there isn't any multiplication here. Next, we simplify the additions and subtractions from left to right.

Starting with 6 - -7, subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so 6 + 7 = 13.

Then, 13 + -2 is the same as 13 - 2 = 11.

Finally, 11 - -7. Subtracting a negative is like adding a positive, so 11 + 7 = 18.

So, the second part of the expression simplifies to 18.

- The minus sign before -2 can be changed to addition because subtracting a negative is like adding a positive.
- So it becomes: 2 + 2 + (-7) * 8

Now, calculate the multiplication:
-7 * 8 = -56

So the expression now is:
2 + 2 - 56

Combine the numbers:
(2 + 2) - 56 = 4 - 56 = -52

Now, let's move on to the second part of the expression:
(-7 * (-8) * 3 - (-2))

First, do the multiplications:
-7 * (-8) = 56
56 * 3 = 168

Then, handle the subtraction:
168 - (-2) = 168 + 2 = 170

Now we have two parts simplified: -52 and 170. We need to multiply these together:

-52 * 170

To calculate this, I'll break it down into simpler steps:

For the first part (-6 - 6 + 7 - 7):

-6 - 6 = -12
-12 + 7 = -5
-5 - 7 = -12

So, (-6 - 6 + 7 - 7) simplifies to -12.

Next, let's simplify the second part (5 + 3 - 9 * -8).

According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we should perform multiplication before addition and subtraction. So,

-9 * -8 = 72 (since the product of two negative numbers is positive)

Now, add 5 and 3:

5 + 3 = 8

Then subtract 72 from 8:

8 - 72 = -64

So, the second part simplifies to -64.

Now we have:

-12 - (-64)

Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding a positive:

The expression is: ((7 - 4 + (-3 * 4)) - (5 + (-8 - 6 + (-5))))

First, we need to handle the operations inside the parentheses. Let's start with the left side:

1. Inside the first set of parentheses:
   - Calculate the multiplication: -3 * 4 = -12.
   - Now the expression becomes: (7 - 4 + (-12)).
   - Next, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: 7 - 4 = 3, then 3 + (-12) = 3 - 12 = -9.
   So, the left side simplifies to -9.

Now let's look at the right side:

2. Inside the second set of parentheses:
   - First, calculate the innermost operation: -8 - 6 + (-5).
   - Simplify: -8 - 6 = -14, then -14 + (-5) = -14 - 5 = -19.
   - Now the expression becomes: 5 + (-19).
   - Perform the addition: 5 + (-19) = 5 - 19 = -14.
   So, the right side simplifies to -14.

Now we can substitute these results back into the original expression:

-9 - (-14)

When subtracting a negative number, it's the same as adding its positive counterpart:

-9 + 14

Perform the addition:

-9 + 14 = 5

So, the final answer is 5.

-6 multiplied by -1 gives 6 (since negative times negative is positive).
So it becomes (6 - 2 - 2).

Now simplifying that: 6 - 2 = 4, then 4 - 2 = 2.
So the first part simplifies to 2.

Next, for the second part: (9 - 4 + -1 - 7)
9 - 4 = 5

4 - 7 = -3

So the second part simplifies to -3.

1. Calculate 8 * -6:
   8 * -6 = -48

2. Then add 6 * 1:
   6 * 1 = 6
   So, -48 + 6 = -42

Now, let's move to the second part of the expression:

1. Calculate -3 * 7 * 0:

Next, let's simplify the part in the second set of parentheses:

-9 - 5 + 7 + 1

I'll do it step by step:

-9 - 5 = -14
-14 + 7 = -7

Inside the parentheses, there's a multiplication and subtraction. According to order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), I should do that first:

(-8 * 3 = -24)

So the expression becomes (1 - 7 - (-24))

Now, subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart:

-6 + 24 = 18

So far, we have 18. Now let's move to the second part: (-7 - (-2 + (-3 * 6)))

Again, start with the innermost operation:

(-3 * 6 = -18)

So the expression now is (-7 - (-2 - 18))

Subtracting a negative is like adding a positive:

1. Calculate 5 * -8:

2. Calculate -5 * -9:
   -5 * -9 = 45 (negative times negative gives positive)

3. Now subtract -40 from 45. Subtracting a negative is like adding the positive:
   -40 - (-45) = -40 + 45 = 5

So, the first part simplifies to 5.

Next, let's simplify the second set of parentheses: (2 - -7 * 6 - 4).

1. Calculate -7 * 6:

Inside the parentheses, we have 6 - 1 and then subtracting the product of -1 and 5.
6 - 1 = 5
-1 * 5 = -5

So, the expression becomes: 5 - (-5)

Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart:
5 - (-5) = 5 + 5 = 10

So, the second part simplifies to 10.

Now we multiply the results of both parts:
(-17) * (10)

Multiplying these integers gives:
-170

The final answer is -170. Let me write it in the required format.

The expression given is: 

(-5 + 6 - -5 + -6) + (-4 + -6 - 3 - 7)

First, let's simplify the expressions inside the parentheses separately.

For the first part:

-5 + 6 - -5 + -6

I know that subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:

-5 + 6 + 5 - 6

Now, combine like terms:

-5 + 5 = 0 (the negatives cancel out)
6 - 6 = 0 (the positives cancel out)

So the first part simplifies to 0.

Now for the second part:

-4 + -6 - 3 - 7

Again, subtracting a negative is adding a positive, so:

-4 - 6 - 3 - 7

Combine the numbers:

-4 - 6 = -10
-10 - 3 = -13
-13 - 7 = -20

So the second part simplifies to -20.

Now we put the simplified parts together:

0 + (-20)

Since any number plus zero is itself, we have:

-20

Therefore, the final answer is -20, which is an integer. So the answer in JSON format would be:

First, let's simplify the part inside the first set of parentheses: (0 - -1 + -1 + -3). 

Starting with the subtraction of negative numbers:
- Subtracting -1 is the same as adding 1, so 0 + 1 = 1.
- Then, subtract another -1, which is the same as adding 1 again, so 1 + 1 = 2.
- Finally, add -3, which means subtract 3 from 2, so 2 - 3 = -1.

So, the first part simplifies to -1.

Next, let's simplify the part inside the second set of parentheses: (-3 * 0 * 8 + 6).

First, calculate the multiplication:
- 0 times any number is 0, so -3 * 0 * 8 = 0.

Then, add 6 to 0, which just leaves 6.

So, the second part simplifies to 6.

Now, we need to subtract the simplified second part from the simplified first part:
-1 - 6 = -7.

So, the final answer is -7. Since the instruction says the answer should be in INTEGER format, the answer is -7.

Inside the first set of parentheses:
1. Multiply -6 by 9: -6 * 9 = -54.
2. Add -8 and -54: -8 + (-54) = -62.
3. Subtract 7 from -62: -62 - 7 = -69.

So, the first part simplifies to -69.

Now, let's do the second part: (8 + 2 * -9 * -7).

1. Multiply -9 by -7: -9 * -7 = 63.
2. Multiply 2 by 63: 2 * 63 = 126.
3. Add 8 and 126: 8 + 126 = 134.

So, the second part simplifies to 134.

(-3 * 0 * 4 - -7)

Multiplying any number by zero gives zero, so:

-3 * 0 = 0

Then multiplying that result by four:

0 * 4 = 0

Now subtracting negative seven (which is the same as adding seven):

0 - (-7) = 0 + 7 = 7

So the first part simplifies to 7.

Next, let's simplify the second part:

(-9 * -6 - -8 + 1)

First, multiply -9 and -6:

-9 * -6 = 54

Now substitute back into the expression:

(54 - -8 + 1)

Subtracting negative eight is the same as adding eight:

54 + 8 = 62

Finally, add one:

62 + 1 = 63

So now we have:

The expression given is: 

((-5 - 2 + 9 * -1) * (7 - 5 + 9 * -7))

First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division (which we can skip because there are no division operations here), and finally addition and subtraction.

Starting with the left parenthesis:

1. Inside the left parenthesis:
   -5 - 2 + 9 * (-1)

Since multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, I'll do that first:
-5 - 2 + (9 * -1)
-5 - 2 + (-9)  [because 9 * -1 = -9]

Now add/subtract from left to right:
-5 - 2 = -7
-7 + (-9) = -16

So, the left parenthesis simplifies to -16.

Now for the right parenthesis:

7 - 5 + 9 * (-7)

Again, multiplication before addition/subtraction:
7 - 5 + (9 * -7)
7 - 5 + (-63)  [because 9 * -7 = -63]

Now perform the addition/subtraction from left to right:
7 - 5 = 2
2 + (-63) = 2 - 63 = -61

So, the right parenthesis simplifies to -61.

Finally, multiply the results of the two simplified expressions:

(-16) * (-61)

When multiplying two negative numbers, the result is positive:
16 * 61 = 976

So, the final answer is 976.

5 - 7 = -2
-2 - 8 = -10
-10 - 6 = -16

So, 5 - 7 - 8 - 6 simplifies to -16.

Next, let's handle the multiplication and addition in the second part: -2 * -8 * -9 + 4.

When multiplying negative numbers, the product of two negatives is positive, and the product of a positive and a negative is negative. Let's do it step-by-step:

-2 * -8 = 16 (positive times positive)
16 * -9 = -144 (negative times positive)

Now add 4:
-144 + 4 = -140

So, -2 * -8 * -9 + 4 simplifies to -140.

Okay, let me break it down:

1. Inside the first set of parentheses: (-5 - 6 * 5 + -9)
   - Multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so 6 * 5 = 30.
   - Now the expression becomes (-5 - 30 + -9).
   - Next, do the additions and subtractions from left to right: -5 - 30 = -35, then -35 + -9 = -44.
   So, the first part simplifies to -44.

2. Now for the second set of parentheses: (1 + -4 - -2 * 6)

The expression is: ((3 * 9 - 3 * 2) + (-1 * -7 - 1 - -9))

First, I'll handle the multiplication inside the parentheses:

1. Calculate 3 * 9:
   3 * 9 = 27

2. Calculate 3 * 2:
   3 * 2 = 6

3. Calculate -1 * -7:
   -1 * -7 = 7

Now substitute these values back into the expression:

(27 - 6) + (7 - 1 - -9)

Next, perform the subtraction and addition within each set of parentheses:

4. Subtract 6 from 27:
   27 - 6 = 21

5. Add 7 - 1 - -9:
   First, calculate 7 - 1:
   7 - 1 = 6
   
   Then add -9 (which is the same as subtracting 9):
   6 - 9 = -3

Now we have:

21 + (-3)

Finally, add these together:

21 + (-3) = 18

So the final result is 18. The problem asks for an integer answer, which it is, so the answer is 18.

First, let's calculate the part inside the parentheses: -8 * -6 + -9 + -5.

Multiplying -8 and -6 gives us 48 (because a negative times a negative is positive). So now we have:

48 + -9 + -5

Adding -9 and -5 to 48:

48 - 9 - 5 = 39 - 5 = 34

So the expression simplifies to (7 * 9 * 3 * 6) * 34.

Now, let's calculate the product of 7 * 9 * 3 * 6:

7 * 9 = 63
63 * 3 = 189
189 * 6 = 1134

So the expression becomes 1134 * 34.

To find the integer result, I'll multiply these numbers directly:

1134 * 34 = 38556

1 + 1 + (-7 * -6)

-7 times -6 equals 42 because negative times negative gives positive. So,

1 + 1 + 42 = 44

Now, let's evaluate the second part:

4 * 2 * -5 + -5

First, multiply 4 and 2, which equals 8. Then multiply that result by -5, giving -40. Adding -5 to -40:

-40 + (-5) = -45

The expression is ((1 + 1 * 3 - 2) * (-8 - -2 - 9 + -9)). First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (also from left to right).

Okay, let's start with the innermost parentheses in the first part:

1 + 1 * 3 - 2

According to the order of operations, multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So, I'll do 1 * 3 first:

1 + 3 - 2

Now add 1 and 3:

4 - 2

Subtract 2 from 4:

2

So, the first part simplifies to 2.

Next, let's simplify the second part of the expression:

-8 - -2 - 9 + -9

When subtracting a negative number, it's the same as adding a positive number. So, - -2 becomes +2, and - -9 becomes +9. Now we have:

-8 + 2 = -6

-6 - 9 = -15

First, let's handle the multiplication inside the parentheses:

1. Inside the first set of parentheses: 5 + 6 * 4 * 9
   - First, do the multiplications: 6 * 4 = 24, then 24 * 9 = 216.
   - So, 5 + 216 = 221.

Now we have: (221) + (-9 - 0 * 3 - 1)

Next, let's work on the second set of parentheses: -9 - 0 * 3 - 1

2. Inside the second set of parentheses: -9 - 0 * 3 - 1
   - First, do the multiplication: 0 * 3 = 0.
   - Then, -9 - 0 - 1 = -10.

So the expression now looks like:

(-1 - 9 + 81) - (1 + -3 - 5 - 5)

Next, let's simplify each part separately. Starting with the first part:

-1 - 9 + 81

Add -1 and -9 to get -10, then add 81:

-1 and -6 are both negative, so adding them would be subtracting their absolute values.
-1 + -6 = -7

Now, subtracting -4 (which is the same as adding 4):

-7 + 4 = -3

Finally, add -6:

First, let's simplify inside the parentheses:

1. For the first part: (-2 - (-7) + 5 * (-3))
   - Inside the parentheses, we have -2 minus negative 7, which is the same as adding 7: -2 + 7 = 5.
   - Then we multiply 5 by -3: 5 * (-3) = -15.
   - Now we add these results together: 5 + (-15) = 5 - 15 = -10.

So the first part simplifies to -10.

2. For the second part: (2 - 8 + 5 * (-7))
   - First, -8 plus 2 is -6.
   - Then, 5 times -7 is -35.
   - Adding these together: -6 + (-35) = -6 - 35 = -41.

So the second part simplifies to -41.

Now we add the simplified parts together:
-10 + (-41) = -10 - 41 = -51.

First, let's handle the innermost parentheses: (3 - (-6) - 7 + 3). The minus sign before -6 means it's the same as adding 6. So, that part becomes:

3 + 6 - 7 + 3

Now, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

3 + 6 = 9

9 - 7 = 2

Inside the innermost parentheses, there's another operation involving multiplication and subtraction: -9 * 8 - (-9). When you multiply -9 by 8, it becomes -72. Then subtracting -9 (which is the same as adding 9), so -72 + 9 = -63. Now the expression simplifies to:

Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding the positive counterpart, so:

Next, let's simplify the second part: -9 - 2 * (-6) + (-6).

First, multiply 2 by -6, which gives -12. So the expression becomes:

38 + (-6) = 38 - 6 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is 32.

Since the instruction says to use ""INTEGER"" as the answer and 32 is an integer, the correct JSON response would be:

((6 - 1 - -3 + -2) + (5 * 5 + -1 - -8))","{""ANSWER"": INTEGER}",,"Let's try to solve this problem step by step.

The expression given is:

((6 - 1 - (-3) + (-2)) + (5 * 5 + (-1) - (-8)))

First, I need to simplify the expression inside the first set of parentheses: (6 - 1 - (-3) + (-2))

Starting from the inside:
- The term ""-(-3)"" is actually ""+3"" because subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive.
- So the expression becomes: (6 - 1 + 3 - 2)

Now let's do the arithmetic inside the parentheses:
- 6 - 1 = 5
- 5 + 3 = 8
- 8 - 2 = 6

So the first part simplifies to 6.

Next, let's simplify the second set of parentheses: (5 * 5 + (-1) - (-8))

Again, let's start with the multiplication:
- 5 * 5 = 25

Then, dealing with the addition and subtraction:
- 25 + (-1) = 24
- 24 - (-8) = 24 + 8 = 32

So the second part simplifies to 32.

Finally, we add the results from both sets of parentheses:
- 6 + 32 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is 38.

The expression given is:

(-4 + 4 + 3 * 1) - (-9 - -3 + -6 - 5)

First, let's simplify inside the parentheses.

For the first part: (-4 + 4 + 3 * 1)

-4 + 4 = 0 (because any number plus its negative equals zero)
0 + 3 * 1 = 0 + 3 = 3

So, the first part simplifies to 3.

Now for the second part: (-9 - -3 + -6 - 5)

-9 - -3 = -9 + 3 = -6 (subtracting a negative is like adding a positive)
-6 + -6 = -12 (adding two negatives makes a more negative number)
-12 - 5 = -17 (subtracting a positive from a negative)

So, the second part simplifies to -17.

Now we have:

3 - (-17)

Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive of that number, so:

3 + 17 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is 20. The integer part of 20 is 20 itself, since it's already an integer.

The given expression is:

First, let's simplify the terms inside each parenthesis.

For the first part: 

-3 - (-6) - (-7) + 3

Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart, so:

-3 + 6 + 7 + 3

Now, let's add these numbers together:

-3 + 6 = 3  
3 + 7 = 10  
10 + 3 = 13

So, the first part simplifies to 13.

Now for the second part:

5 * 5 * 1 - (-3)

Multiplication and addition can be done in any order, so let's do the multiplication first:

5 * 5 = 25  
25 * 1 = 25

Then subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart:

25 - (-3) = 25 + 3 = 28

So, the second part simplifies to 28.

Calculate -8 * 4:
-8 * 4 = -32

Now add 7 and subtract 5:

So, the first part simplifies to -30.

Next, let's work on the second parenthesis: (9 + -6 + -2 * 5).

Calculate -2 * 5:
-2 * 5 = -10

Now add 9, subtract 6, and add -10:
9 - 6 - 10 = -7

So, the second part simplifies to -7.

Now we combine the results of both parts: -30 + (-7).

Add -30 and -7:

   Inside the parentheses, we have (-6 * 7 * 0). Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, (-6 * 7 * 0) = 0.

- Multiply the numbers: 5 * 1 = 5, then 5 * 3 = 15.
- Subtract 9 from the result: 15 - 9 = 6.
So, 5 * 1 * 3 - 9 equals 6.

Next, let's evaluate the second part: (-7 + 4 - -7 * -3)

In this part, we have multiplication before addition and subtraction according to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

Calculate -7 * -3:
-7 * -3 = 21 (since negative times negative gives positive).

Now substitute back into the expression:
-7 + 4 - 21

Evaluate from left to right:
-7 + 4 = -3
-3 - 21 = -24

So, -7 + 4 - -7 * -3 equals -24.

1. Calculate the inner part of the first parenthesis:
   5 - (-2 * -9 + 8)
   First, calculate -2 * -9 = 18.
   Then, 18 + 8 = 26.

Now we have: (-21) - (3 - 4 * (-3 - (-6)))

Next, simplify the inner part of the second parenthesis:
-3 - (-6) = -3 + 6 = 3.

In the first part: 9 * 1 = 9.
In the second part: 3 * 1 = 3.

So the expression becomes ((7 + 1 + 9) + (7 + 3 + 3)).

Next, let's add within each parenthesis:

First, let's simplify the part inside the first set of parentheses: (-6 + -2 * 3 * 0).

Inside that, there's multiplication before addition. So we calculate -2 * 3 * 0. Any number multiplied by zero is zero, so -2 * 3 * 0 = 0.

For the first part (-8 + -4 * -9 * 0):
- The multiplication part is -4 * -9 * 0.
- Any number multiplied by zero equals zero, so -4 * -9 * 0 = 0.
- Therefore, -8 + 0 = -8.

So, the first part simplifies to -8.

First, let's handle the expressions inside the parentheses.

For the first part: (-8 + 6 - 8 * -9)

Inside the parentheses, we have two operations: addition/subtraction and multiplication. According to the order of operations, we do multiplication before addition/subtraction. So:

-8 * -9 = 72

Now, substitute that back into the expression:

(-8 + 6 + 72)

Next, perform the addition/subtraction from left to right:

-8 + 6 = -2

So now it's:

9 * -2 = -18

Substitute that back in:

(9 - 18 - 1)

Now, perform the addition/subtraction from left to right:

First, let's calculate the inner expressions:

1. For the first part, 9 - (-6 * 9 * 4):
   - Calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses: -6 * 9 * 4.
   - First, -6 * 9 = -54.
   - Then, -54 * 4 = -216.
   - Now, add 9 to -216: 9 + (-216) = -207.

So, the first part simplifies to -207.

Starting with the first part of the expression inside the parentheses:

(-1 * -6 - -1 - -8)

Calculate (-1 * -6):
-1 multiplied by -6 equals 6.

So the expression becomes:

((-7 - -4 * 2 - 9) * (9 - 6 - 1 + -4))","{""ANSWER"": INTEGER}",,"Let's solve this step by step.

The expression is: ((-7 - (-4 * 2) - 9) * (9 - 6 - 1 + (-4)))

First, I need to simplify the terms inside the parentheses. Let's start with the left side of the multiplication:

(-7 - (-4 * 2) - 9)

Inside the first set of parentheses, there's a subtraction of a product. First, calculate -4 * 2:

-4 * 2 = -8

Now substitute back into the expression:

(-7 - (-8) - 9)

Next, simplify -7 - (-8):

-7 - (-8) = -7 + 8 = 1

So now we have:

(1 - 9)

Simplify that:

1 - 9 = -8

So the left side simplifies to -8.

Now let's simplify the right side of the multiplication:

(9 - 6 - 1 + (-4))

Calculate each term step-by-step:

9 - 6 = 3

3 - 1 = 2

2 + (-4) = 2 - 4 = -2

So the right side simplifies to -2.

Now we multiply the simplified results of both sides:

(-8) * (-2)

Multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result:

-8 * -2 = 16

So the final answer is 16. Since the question asks for an integer, the answer is indeed an integer.

((-9 * 4 * -9 - -9) * (5 * 2 * 6 * -2))","{""ANSWER"": INTEGER}",,"Let's solve this step by step.

The given expression is:

((-9 * 4 * -9 - -9) * (5 * 2 * 6 * -2))

First, let's break it down into two parts and evaluate each part separately.

Part 1: (-9 * 4 * -9 - -9)

Calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses first:
-9 * 4 = -36
Then multiply that result by -9:
-36 * -9 = 324

Now, subtract -9 from the result:
324 - (-9) = 324 + 9 = 333

So, part 1 evaluates to 333.

Part 2: (5 * 2 * 6 * -2)

Calculate the multiplication:
5 * 2 = 10
Then multiply that result by 6:
10 * 6 = 60
Finally, multiply by -2:
60 * -2 = -120

So, part 2 evaluates to -120.

Now we need to multiply the results of both parts together:
333 * -120

To simplify this, let's break it down further:
333 * -120 = 333 * (-12 * 10) = -(333 * 12 * 10)

Calculate 333 * 12:
333 * 12 = 3996

Then multiply by 10:
3996 * 10 = 39960

Therefore, the final answer is -39960.

The expression is: 

(-9 + -3 + 6 - 8) - (-7 * -2 * -6 + -6)

First, let's simplify the terms inside the parentheses separately.

For the first part:

-9 + -3 + 6 - 8

Combine like terms:

-9 - 3 = -12

-12 + 6 = -6

-6 - 8 = -14

So, -9 + -3 + 6 - 8 simplifies to -14.

Now, for the second part:

-7 * -2 * -6 + -6

Multiplication of negative numbers gives a positive result. So,

-7 * -2 = 14

Then,

14 * -6 = -84

Finally,

-84 + -6 = -90

So, -7 * -2 * -6 + -6 simplifies to -90.

Now we can substitute these simplified results back into the original expression:

-14 - (-90)

When subtracting a negative number, it's equivalent to adding its positive counterpart:

-14 + 90

14 + 90 = 104

The expression given is: ((-7 + 5 * (-6) * (-6)) * (7 * (-5) + (-6) - 7))

First, let's simplify the terms inside the parentheses.

1. Calculate the innermost terms:
   - For the first part: (-7 + 5 * (-6) * (-6))
     - First, calculate 5 * (-6) = -30.
     - Then, multiply that by (-6): -30 * (-6) = 180.
     - Finally, add -7: -7 + 180 = 173.
   
   So, the first part simplifies to 173.

2. Now, for the second part: (7 * (-5) + (-6) - 7)
   - First, calculate 7 * (-5) = -35.
   - Then, add -6: -35 + (-6) = -41.
   - Finally, subtract 7: -41 - 7 = -48.
   
   So, the second part simplifies to -48.

Now we have the simplified expression: (173 * (-48))

Finally, multiply these two numbers:

173 * (-48) = -8304

So, the final answer is -8304.

The expression is:

(-8 * 0 + 2 * 2) * (-9 - 1 * -9 * 3)

First, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses.

For the first part: (-8 * 0 + 2 * 2)
-8 times 0 is 0.
2 times 2 is 4.
So, -8 * 0 + 2 * 2 = 0 + 4 = 4.

Now the expression becomes:

4 * (-9 - 1 * -9 * 3)

Next, we need to simplify the second part: (-9 - 1 * -9 * 3)
-1 times -9 is 9 (because a negative times a negative is positive).
Then, 9 times 3 is 27.
So, -9 - 27 = -36.

Now the expression is:

4 * (-36)

Finally, multiplying 4 by -36 gives us -144.

So the final answer is -144. The instruction says to respond with ""INTEGER"" as the answer format, so the JSON response should be {""ANSWER"": ""INTEGER""}. Let me confirm if there were any mistakes in my calculations. 

I'll recheck:

1. First part: (-8 * 0 + 2 * 2) = 0 + 4 = 4
2. Second part: (-9 - 1 * -9 * 3) = -9 + 27 = 18
3. Multiplying: 4 * 18 = 72

Wait, no, I made an error earlier. The correct calculation for the second part should be:

-9 - 1 * -9 * 3

So the correct expression is:

4 * 18 = 72.

Therefore, the correct answer is 72, not -144. The JSON response should be {""ANSWER"": 72}.

Starting with the first part (9 + 2 + 3 - -3):
- When subtracting a negative number, it's the same as adding that number. So -(-3) becomes +3.
- So the expression becomes 9 + 2 + 3 + 3.

Adding these up:
9 + 2 = 11
11 + 3 = 14
14 + 3 = 17

So the first part simplifies to 17.

Now for the second part (-5 + 6 - -6 - -9):
Again, -(-6) and -(-9) both become positive numbers.
So the expression becomes -5 + 6 + 6 + 9.

Adding these up:
-5 + 6 = 1

Calculate each part:
- 5 - 6 = -1
- -1 - 7 = -8
- -8 + 6 = -2

So, the left part simplifies to -2.

Next, let's look at the right part: (-1 - 1 * -7 + 9).

We have to follow the order of operations, which means multiplication before addition and subtraction. So first calculate 1 * -7:

1 * -7 = -7

Now substitute back into the expression:

Simplify the subtraction of a negative number, which is equivalent to adding a positive number:

Now add these numbers together:

-1 + 7 = 6

   - Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart, so -(-7) becomes +7.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes (-9 + 7 + 2 + 2).

2. Simplify the second set of parentheses: (-7 + -9 - (-1) - 0)
   - Again, subtracting a negative is like adding a positive, so -(-1) is +1.
   - So the expression becomes (-7 - 9 + 1 - 0).

Now, let's add these simplified expressions together.

For the first set: (-9 + 7 + 2 + 2):
- -9 + 7 = -2
- -2 + 2 = 0
- 0 + 2 = 2

- -15 - 0 = -15

So the second part simplifies to -15.

Finally, we need to add the results from both sets:

1. Calculate -8 * -3:
   -8 times -3 equals 24 because the product of two negative numbers is positive.

2. Simplify 24 and -5:
   6 + 24 = 30
   
   Then, 30 - (-5)

3. Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the positive version of that number:

So, the first part simplifies to 35.

Now let's look at the second part: 2 - 7 * -2 * -8

1. Calculate 7 * -2:

2. Multiply -14 by -8:

To find the product, I can break it down:

((0 + -9 * 6 * 4) + (5 - -3 + 8 * 5))

First, I need to handle the operations inside each parenthesis.

Starting with the first parenthesis:

0 + (-9 * 6 * 4)

Calculate the multiplication first according to order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

-9 * 6 = -54

Then multiply that result by 4:

-54 * 4 = -216

So the first part simplifies to:

0 + (-216) = -216

Now let's move to the second parenthesis:

5 - (-3) + 8 * 5

First, calculate the subtraction and multiplication:

5 - (-3) = 5 + 3 = 8

Then multiply 8 by 5:

8 * 5 = 40

So the second part simplifies to:

8 + 40 = 48

Now we add the results from both parentheses:

-216 + 48

Perform the addition:

-216 + 48 = -168

The final answer is -168.

Since the instruction asks for an ""INTEGER"" as the answer, and -168 is indeed an integer, the JSON response should be:

((-4 - -6 - -5 - 5) - (-2 + -4 - -8 + 6))

First, I need to simplify the terms inside the parentheses.

For the first part of the expression, -4 - -6 - -5 - 5:
- Subtracting a negative is like adding, so it becomes +6.
- Then subtracting another -5 is like adding 5, so that's +11.
- And then subtracting 5 from 11 is 6.

So, -4 - -6 - -5 - 5 simplifies to 6.

Now for the second part: -2 + -4 - -8 + 6:
- Adding a negative is like subtracting, so -2 + -4 = -6.
- Then subtracting a negative is like adding, so -6 - -8 = -6 + 8 = 2.
- Finally, adding 6 to 2 gives us 8.

So, -2 + -4 - -8 + 6 simplifies to 8.

Now we have: (6 - 8)

6 - 8 equals -2.

Therefore, the final answer is -2. Since the instruction specifies the answer should be an integer, the correct JSON response is {""ANSWER"": -2}.",,2025-05-10 23:22:54

The expression given is: (-3 + -4 * 3 - -8) + (8 - 1 - -4 - -1).

First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). There are no exponents in this problem, so we'll start with the parentheses.

Let's handle the first part inside the first set of parentheses: (-3 + -4 * 3 - -8).

Inside that, there's a multiplication operation: -4 * 3 = -12. So, the expression becomes: (-3 + -12 - -8).

Now, let's simplify the additions and subtractions within the parentheses:

-3 - 12 = -15
-15 - -8 = -15 + 8 = -7

So, the first part simplifies to -7.

Next, let's look at the second part: (8 - 1 - -4 - -1).

Again, we have subtraction and addition inside the parentheses. Let's simplify it step by step:

8 - 1 = 7
7 - -4 = 7 + 4 = 11
11 - -1 = 11 + 1 = 12

So, the second part simplifies to 12.

Now, we add the results from both parts together:

-7 + 12 = 5

First, let's simplify the innermost part of the expression: -9 * 6 * -1 - (-3).

Calculate -9 * 6 = -54. Then multiply that by -1, which gives 54 (because negative times negative is positive). Finally, subtract -3, which is the same as adding 3.

So, -9 * 6 * -1 - (-3) = 54 + 3 = 57.

Now, we have simplified the second part of the original expression to 57. Next, we need to simplify the first part: (-4 - 5 + 2 + 7).

Let's do the arithmetic inside the parentheses:

-4 - 5 = -9
-9 + 2 = -7
-7 + 7 = 0

So, (-4 - 5 + 2 + 7) = 0.

Now, we can substitute back into the original expression:

For the first part of the equation: (8 + 1 + 6 + 6)

I'll add these numbers together:
8 + 1 = 9
9 + 6 = 15
15 + 6 = 21

So, the first part simplifies to 21.

Now for the second part: (7 - -7 - 9 - -8)

Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the positive counterpart. So:
7 - (-7) = 7 + 7 = 14
14 - 9 = 5
5 - (-8) = 5 + 8 = 13

So, the second part simplifies to 13.

Now, subtract the second simplified result from the first:

First, let's handle the multiplication inside the parentheses:
1. For the first part: (-9 * -5 - 5 + 7)
   -9 times -5 equals 45.
   So it becomes (45 - 5 + 7).
   
2. Now, for the second part: (-3 - 8 + 9 * -2)
   -9 times -2 equals 18.
   So it becomes (-3 - 8 + 18).

Next, we perform the addition and subtraction within each set of parentheses:
1. First part: 45 - 5 + 7
   -45 + 7 = -38.
   So now we have (-38 - (-3 - 8 + 18)).

2. Second part: -3 - 8 + 18
   -3 - 8 = -11.
   -11 + 18 = 7.
   So now we have (-38 - 7).

Finally, subtracting 7 from -38:

Starting with the first part inside the parentheses: (0 + 1 - (-6) * 9). Inside the parentheses, there's a subtraction that involves a negative number. Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive counterpart. So, (-6) * 9 = -54. Then, 0 + 1 - (-54) simplifies to 0 + 1 + 54, which equals 55.

Next, we move on to the second part of the expression: (4 + 7 + (-9) - 8). Again, the subtraction involving a negative is addition. So, 4 + 7 - 9 - 8. Let's simplify it step by step:

First, add 4 and 7: 4 + 7 = 11.
Then subtract 9: 11 - 9 = 2.
Finally, subtract 8: 2 - 8 = -6.

So now we have (55) * (-6). Multiplying these two integers together gives us -330.

Therefore, the final answer is -330. Since the instruction asks for an integer answer, the answer should indeed be an integer. Thus, the JSON response should be {""ANSWER"": -330}.

I believe the calculation was correct, but let me double-check one more time just to be sure. Starting again from the beginning:

1. Inside the parentheses, start with the multiplication:
   -3 * -2 = 6

So the expression becomes:
[(-1 + -6 + 6) * (-9 * -1 + 2 - 3)]

2. Now do the additions inside the first set of parentheses:
   -1 + -6 + 6 = -1

So now it looks like:
[-1 * (-9 * -1 + 2 - 3)]

Next, do the multiplication in the second set of parentheses:
-9 * -1 = 9

So it simplifies to:
[-1 * (9 + 2 - 3)]

3. Perform the addition inside the second set of parentheses:

First, let's handle the expressions inside the parentheses separately.

For the first part: (6 * 5 + 0 - -3)
- Calculate the multiplication: 6 * 5 = 30
- Then add 0: 30 + 0 = 30
- Finally, subtract -3, which is the same as adding 3: 30 + 3 = 33

So the first part simplifies to 33.

Now for the second part: (4 * 5 * 3 + 0)
- First, do the multiplications: 4 * 5 = 20, then 20 * 3 = 60
- Add 0: 60 + 0 = 60

Now we have to multiply these two results together: 33 * 60

- The multiplication inside the first set of parentheses:
  -2 * -1 = 2 (negative times negative equals positive)
  1 * -3 = -3 (positive times negative equals negative)

First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (also from left to right).

Step 1: Evaluate the innermost parentheses.

Inside the first set of parentheses:
1 + 2 * -1 - -8

According to the order of operations, multiplication comes before addition or subtraction. So, let's do that first:

2 * -1 = -2

Now the expression inside the first set becomes:
1 + -2 - -8

Next, subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive:
1 - 2 + 8

Now, perform the additions and subtractions from left to right:
1 - 2 = -1
-1 + 8 = 7

So, the first set of parentheses evaluates to 7.

Step 2: Now we have: 7 - (-8 - 2 - -1 + 6)

Next, evaluate the second set of parentheses:
-8 - 2 - -1 + 6

Again, according to the order of operations, we start with subtraction and addition from left to right:

-8 - 2 = -10
-10 - -1 = -10 + 1 = -9
-9 + 6 = -3

So, the second set of parentheses evaluates to -3.

Step 3: Finally, subtract the result of the second set from the result of the first set:

7 - (-3) = 7 + 3 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is 10.

The expression given is: 

((-6 * -2 + -2 - -9) + (-9 * 3 * -1 + -1))

First, I need to simplify the terms inside the parentheses.

Starting with the first part:

(-6 * -2 + -2 - -9)

-6 times -2 is 12 because negative numbers multiplied together give positive. So,

12 + -2 - -9

Adding and subtracting these numbers:

12 - 2 = 10

Then subtracting -9 (which is the same as adding 9):

10 + 9 = 19

So the first part simplifies to 19.

Now for the second part:

(-9 * 3 * -1 + -1)

First, multiply -9 by 3:

-27 * -1 = 27

Then add -1:

27 + -1 = 26

So the second part simplifies to 26.

Now we combine both parts:

19 + 26 = 45

Therefore, the final answer is 45.

-1 times -3 is 3.
Then subtract 2: 3 - 2 = 1.
Finally, add -7: 1 + (-7) = 1 - 7 = -6.

So, the first part simplifies to -6.

Now, let's do the second part: (4 * 8 * -6 - -2)
First, multiply 4 and 8: 4 * 8 = 32.
Then multiply that result by -6: 32 * -6 = -192.
Next, subtract -2, which is the same as adding 2: -192 + 2 = -190.

So, the second part simplifies to -190.

Now we have the simplified expression:
-6 + (-190)

Adding these together gives:
-6 - 190 = -196

   - According to PEMDAS, multiplication comes before addition and subtraction.
   - So, calculate 6 * -1: 6 * -1 = -6.
   - Now the expression becomes: 8 - 6 - -3.

   Next, subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart:

So, the first part simplifies to 5.

Next, we simplify the second set of parentheses:

2. In the second set: -5 * 0 - -7 * 1

   - First, calculate the multiplications:
     - -5 * 0 = 0.
     - -7 * 1 = -7.

   Now, substitute these values back into the expression:

The given expression is: 

((-5 - (-1) - 7 * 8) * (-1 - (-4) * (-7) * 2))

First, I need to simplify the expressions inside the parentheses. Let's start with the first part:

1. Simplify (-5 - (-1) - 7 * 8)

Inside the first set of parentheses:
- The minus sign before -1 is equivalent to adding 1, so it becomes -5 + 1.
- Then we have -5 + 1 - 7 * 8.

Now, perform the multiplication:
- 7 * 8 = 56

So the expression becomes:
-5 + 1 - 56

Combine the numbers:
-5 + 1 = -4
-4 - 56 = -60

So, the first part simplifies to -60.

Next, let's look at the second part:

2. Simplify (-1 - (-4) * (-7) * 2)

Inside the second set of parentheses:
- The minus sign before -4 changes it to a plus when multiplied by -4, so it becomes -1 + 4 * (-7) * 2.
- Then we have -1 + 4 * (-7) * 2.

Now, perform the multiplication:
- 4 * (-7) = -28
- -28 * 2 = -56

So the expression becomes:
-1 + (-56)

Combine the numbers:
-1 - 56 = -57

So, the second part simplifies to -57.

Finally, multiply the two simplified parts together:

First, I need to follow the order of operations, which means parentheses first, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (also from left to right).

Step 1: Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses.

For the first part: 4 - 8 - (-9 * 7)

Calculate the multiplication:
-9 * 7 = -63

So, the expression becomes: 4 - 8 - (-63)

Now, perform the subtraction:
4 - 8 = -4
-4 - (-63) = -4 + 63 = 59

So, the first part simplifies to 59.

For the second part: 5 + (-8 * 9 * -2)

Calculate the multiplication:
-8 * 9 = -72
-72 * -2 = 144

So, the expression becomes: 5 + 144

Now, perform the addition:
5 + 144 = 149

So, the second part simplifies to 149.

Now we have: 59 - 149

First, I need to simplify the expressions inside the parentheses. Let's start with the first part: (-7 - (-8) + 5 - (-4)).

Inside the first set of parentheses:
- The minus sign before -8 means it's the same as adding 8, so -(-8) = 8.
- So now we have: -7 + 8 + 5 + 4.
- Simplifying that: -7 + 8 = 1, then 1 + 5 = 6, and finally 6 + 4 = 10.

So the first part simplifies to 10.

Now let's look at the second part: (6 - (-6 * 4) - 3).

Inside the second set of parentheses:
- First, calculate -6 * 4, which equals -24.
- So the expression becomes: 6 - (-24) - 3.
- Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so 6 + 24 = 30.
- Then subtract 3 from 30, which gives us 27.

So the second part simplifies to 27.

Now, add the results from both parts together: 10 + 27 = 37.

-2 - 1 = -3
-3 + 6 = 3
3 - 9 = -6

So, the first part simplifies to -6.

Now, let's handle the second part: (4 * 8 + (-8) * 5). First, multiply the numbers:

4 * 8 = 32
(-8) * 5 = -40

Then add these together:

32 + (-40) = 32 - 40 = -8

So, the second part simplifies to -8.

Next, move to the second part: (-1 + 2 * 7 + 2).

Again, perform the multiplication first:
2 * 7 = 14

Now add/subtract inside the second set of parentheses:
-1 + 14 + 2 = 13

So the second part simplifies to 13.

Now we have:

24 * 13

To multiply these two numbers:

24 * 13 = 24 * (10 + 3) = 24 * 10 + 24 * 3 = 240 + 72 = 312

Therefore, the final answer is 312. The problem asks for an integer answer, so the answer is indeed an integer.

First, let's handle the multiplication and subtraction in the first set of parentheses:
(-9 * -3) = 27 (since negative times negative is positive)
Then subtract 8: 27 - 8 = 19
Next, subtract 5: 19 - 5 = 14

So, the first part simplifies to 14.

Now, let's do the second set of parentheses:
(1 * -2) = -2 (positive times negative is negative)
Then, for the second term, we have -(-4 * 5). The double negative turns it into a positive: (-4 * 5) = -20, so -(-20) = 20.
Finally, add those results: -2 + 20 = 18

The expression given is ((3 + -6 * -2 + 7) * (-6 - -4 - -6 + 6)).

First, let's simplify the inner parentheses:

1. Simplify the first part (3 + -6 * -2 + 7):
   -6 * -2 = 12 (since negative times negative is positive).
   So, 3 + 12 + 7.
   3 + 12 = 15.
   15 + 7 = 22.
   The first part simplifies to 22.

2. Now, simplify the second part (-6 - -4 - -6 + 6):
   -(-4) = 4 (subtracting a negative is like adding a positive).
   -(-6) = 6 (again, subtracting a negative).
   So, the expression becomes:
   -6 + 4 + 6 + 6.
   -6 + 4 = -2.
   -2 + 6 = 4.
   4 + 6 = 10.
   The second part simplifies to 10.

Now we have the simplified expression: (22 * 10).

Any number multiplied by zero is zero. So:

-5 * 0 = 0
0 * 1 = 0

When multiplying negative numbers, the result is negative if there's an odd number of negatives, and positive if there's an even number. Here, we have three negatives, which makes the result negative.

(-6 * -7 = 42)

Again, we need to handle the subtraction of a negative number, which means adding the positive counterpart:

-(-4) = +4

Now, the expression becomes:
-3 * -1 * 2 + 4

Let's calculate this part step by step:

-3 * -1 = 3 (because a negative times a negative is positive)
3 * 2 = 6

So, -3 * -1 * 2 + 4 simplifies to 6 + 4, which equals 10.

Finally, we multiply the two simplified results together:
3 * 10 = 30

So, the final answer is 30. Let me write that in the requested format:

((2 + 7 - -5 - 1) - (0 - 5 - 9 + 0))","{""ANSWER"": INTEGER}",,"Let's solve this step by step to find out the answer. The problem is ((2 + 7 - (-5) - 1) - (0 - 5 - 9 + 0)). First, I need to simplify the expressions inside the parentheses.

Starting with the first set of parentheses: 2 + 7 - (-5) - 1

The minus sign in front of -5 means it's actually addition. So that part becomes:

2 + 7 + 5 - 1

Now add those numbers together:

2 + 7 = 9

9 + 5 = 14

14 - 1 = 13

So the first set of parentheses simplifies to 13.

Next, let's look at the second set of parentheses: 0 - 5 - 9 + 0

Since adding zero doesn't change the value, we can ignore the zeros. So it simplifies to:

-5 - 9

That's -14 when you subtract 9 from -5.

Now we have the simplified expression: 13 - (-14)

Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart. So that becomes:

13 + 14 = 27

The given expression is ((4 * -4 + -6 - -2) - (9 + -7 + -8 * 6)).

First, I need to evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses separately.

1. Evaluate the first part: (4 * -4 + -6 - -2)

   - Calculate 4 * -4:
     4 * -4 = -16

   - Then add -6 and subtract -2:
     -16 + (-6) - (-2)
     -16 - 6 + 2
     -22 + 2
     -20

So, the first part simplifies to -20.

2. Now, evaluate the second part: (9 + -7 + -8 * 6)

   - Calculate -8 * 6:
     -8 * 6 = -48

   - Then add 9, -7, and -48:
     9 + (-7) + (-48)
     9 - 7 - 48
     2 - 48
     -46

So, the second part simplifies to -46.

Now, we need to subtract the second part from the first part:

-20 - (-46)

Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart:

-20 + 46 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is 26. Since the problem asks for an integer answer, the final answer in JSON format would be:

The expression given is:

((3 - 2 - 3 * 3) + (-8 * -1 * -9 * 3))

First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)). So, I'll start with the innermost parentheses first.

Step 1: Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:
(3 - 2 - 3 * 3)

Inside that, we have multiplication before subtraction, so we calculate 3 * 3 first:
(3 - 2 - 9)

Now perform the subtractions from left to right:
(3 - 2) = 1
Then 1 - 9 = -8

So, the first part simplifies to -8.

Now the expression becomes:
(-8 + (-8 * -1 * -9 * 3))

Next, evaluate the second set of parentheses, starting with the multiplication:
-8 * -1 = 8
Then 8 * -9 = -72
Finally, -72 * 3 = -216

So now the expression is:
(-8 + (-216))

Perform the addition:

First, I need to handle the operations inside the parentheses. Let's start with the first part: (-1 * -5 - -3 + -9).

The multiplication and subtraction come first:
-1 * -5 = 5 (because negative times negative is positive)
So, the expression becomes (5 - -3 + -9).

Next, we deal with the subtraction of a negative number, which is equivalent to addition:
- -3 is the same as +3.
So, it becomes (5 + 3 - 9).

Now, let's add and subtract from left to right:
5 + 3 = 8
8 - 9 = -1.

So, the first part simplifies to -1.

Now, let's look at the second part of the original expression: (-5 - 3 * -2 - 5).

Again, start with the multiplication:
3 * -2 = -6 (negative times negative is positive).
So, the expression becomes (-5 - -6 - 5).

So, it becomes (-5 + 6 - 5).

Now, perform the additions and subtractions:
-5 + 6 = 1

1. Calculate 5 * -1:
   5 * -1 = -5

2. Calculate 7 * 5:
   7 * 5 = 35

3. Now subtract these results from each other:
   (-5 - 35) = -40

So, part of the expression simplifies to -40. Let's move on to the second part of the expression.

4. Calculate -(-5 * 3 * 7):
   First, multiply -5 by 3:

Starting with the first part: (9 - -5 - 1 + -2).
- Subtracting a negative is like adding, so 9 - -5 = 9 + 5 = 14.
- Then, subtract 1 from 14: 14 - 1 = 13.
- Finally, add -2 to 13, which is the same as subtracting 2: 13 - 2 = 11.

The expression is: ((-8 - (-3 * 5) + 4) * (2 * 7 - (-3) - (-1)))

First, I need to handle the parentheses from the left side. Let's start with the innermost part first.

Inside the first set of parentheses:
(-8 - (-3 * 5) + 4)

Calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses:
-3 * 5 = -15

So the expression becomes:
(-8 - (-15) + 4)

Next, simplify the subtraction and addition:
-(-15) is the same as +15, so:
-8 + 15 + 4

Now perform the additions:
-8 + 15 = 7
7 + 4 = 11

So the first part simplifies to 11.

Now let's do the second part of the expression:
(2 * 7 - (-3) - (-1))

Calculate the multiplication:
2 * 7 = 14

Then handle the subtractions:
14 - (-3) - (-1)

Subtracting negative numbers is the same as adding positive numbers:
14 - (-3) = 14 + 3 = 17
17 - (-1) = 17 + 1 = 18

So the second part simplifies to 18.

So, 5 - 7 + -6 + 4 simplifies to -4.

Now for the second part: 2 - -9 + 3 - 6.

First, I need to simplify the expressions inside the parentheses. Starting with the first part: (-5 - (-1) - 6 * 0).

Inside the parentheses, there are two operations: subtraction and multiplication. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), I should do the multiplication before the subtraction.

So, let's calculate 6 * 0 first. Any number multiplied by zero is zero, so 6 * 0 = 0.

Now, the expression becomes: (-5 - (-1) - 0). Subtracting zero doesn't change anything, so it simplifies to: (-5 - (-1)).

Next, subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the positive counterpart. So, -(-1) is just +1.

Therefore, (-5 - (-1)) simplifies to (-5 + 1), which equals -4.

Now, moving on to the second part: (-3 + 5 * 0 + 1).

Again, according to PEMDAS, I should do the multiplication first. 5 * 0 = 0.

So, the expression becomes: (-3 + 0 + 1).

Adding 0 doesn't change the value, so it simplifies to: (-3 + 1).

Adding these numbers together:

-3 - 9 = -12
-12 - 3 = -15
-15 - 1 = -16

So, -3 - 9 - 3 - 1 equals -16.

Next, let's look at the second part: -4 * -9 * -7 - -6.

The multiplication starts with negative times negative which makes positive, then negative times negative again makes positive, and finally negative times negative makes positive. So we have:

-4 * -9 = 36 (positive)
36 * -7 = -252 (negative)
-252 - (-6) = -252 + 6 = -246

So, -4 * -9 * -7 - -6 equals -246.

(-3 - -8 - -7 + -2)

The double negatives can be simplified as follows:
- Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive, so -(-8) becomes +8.
- Similarly, -(-7) becomes +7.

So the expression becomes:
(-3 + 8 + 7 - 2)

Now, let's add and subtract these numbers from left to right:

Step 3: Add the results from Step 1 and Step 2.
30 + (-9) = 30 - 9 = 21.

So now we have: (21 - (-1 + -8 * 8 * -9))

Now we have the simplified expression: (-13) - (-8).

When subtracting a negative number, it's the same as adding the positive counterpart. So, (-13) - (-8) = (-13) + 8.

First, I need to evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses separately and then add them together.

Starting with the first part: (-7 - 1 + 3 * -2)

1. Calculate the multiplication: 3 * -2 = -6
2. Now the expression becomes: -7 - 1 - 6

Next, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

-7 - 1 = -8
-8 - 6 = -14

So, the first part simplifies to -14.

Now let's do the second part: (0 - 4 + 6 + 1)

1. Start with the initial number: 0
2. Subtract 4: 0 - 4 = -4
3. Add 6: -4 + 6 = 2
4. Finally, add 1: 2 + 1 = 3

So, the second part simplifies to 3.

I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction.

First, let me simplify inside the parentheses. Starting with the first part: (7 * 2 + 4 - (-6)). Inside the parentheses, there's a multiplication (7 * 2), followed by an addition (4), and then subtraction of negative 6, which is the same as adding 6. So the expression becomes:

(14 + 4 + 6)

Now, perform the addition:

14 + 4 = 18

18 + 6 = 24

So the first part simplifies to 24. Now, let's move to the second part: (6 - 7 - 7 * (-2)). Here, we have a subtraction, a number, another subtraction, and a multiplication. First, do the multiplication: 

7 * (-2) = -14

Now the expression looks like this: (6 - 7 - (-14))

Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart:

6 - 7 + 14

Perform the subtraction:

6 - 7 = -1

-1 + 14 = 13

So the second part simplifies to 13. Now we have the full expression simplified to (24 * 13).

Finally, multiply these two results together:

24 * 13 = 312

Since the question asks for an integer answer, and 312 is already an integer, the final answer is 312. So the JSON response should be {""ANSWER"": 312}.

I'll double-check my calculations to ensure everything is correct. Let me recheck the steps again.

So, -6 * -9 + 1 * 7 = 54 + 7 = 61.

Now for the second part: (0 + 3 * 5 - 2)

3 times 5 equals 15.

So, 0 + 3 * 5 - 2 = 0 + 15 - 2 = 13.

The expression inside the parentheses has multiple operations. Let's break it down:

1. -8 - (-1): This simplifies to -8 + 1 = -7.
2. Then add -8: -7 + (-8) = -7 - 8 = -15.

Now, let's move on to the second part: (7 - (-3) - (-3 * 1)). Let's break it down:

7 - (-3) means subtracting a negative number, which is the same as adding the positive equivalent. So, 7 - (-3) = 7 + 3 = 10.

Next, we need to handle -3 * 1. That's just -3.

So, 10 - (-3) becomes 10 + 3 = 13.

Now, we have the full expression: 168 + 13. Let's add these together:

168 + 13 = 181

The question asks for an integer answer. Since 181 is already an integer, the final answer is 181.

The expression given is:

(-5 * -6 + -9 - 3) + (-7 - -2 - 6 * 6)

First, let's handle the multiplication and division from left to right, then add and subtract from left to right.

1. Calculate inside the first parenthesis:
   -5 * -6 = 30 (since a negative times a negative is positive)
   -9 remains as it is
   -3 remains as it is

So the first part becomes:
30 + (-9) + (-3)

Now simplify that:
30 - 9 - 3 = 18

Next, move on to the second parenthesis:
-7 (remains the same)
-(-2) = 2 (negative of a negative is positive)
-6 * 6 = -36 (a negative times a positive is negative)

So the second part simplifies to:

Calculate inside the parenthesis:
- Start with 6 - 5 = 1
- Then add 5: 1 + 5 = 6
- Finally, add -9: 6 + (-9) = -3

So, the first part simplifies to -3.

Next, we need to simplify the second part of the expression: (9 + 8 * -6 * -1)

According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we need to handle multiplication before addition. So, let's do the multiplications first:

8 * -6 = -48
Then, -48 * -1 = 48 (because two negatives make a positive)

Now, add 9: 9 + 48 = 57

So, the second part simplifies to 57.

(24 + 1 + 3)

Now, add those numbers together:

24 + 1 + 3 = 28

So now the expression is (28 * (-4 * 7 * -3 * 3)).

Next, let's calculate the product inside the second set of parentheses. First, multiply -4 * 7:

-4 * 7 = -28

Then, multiply that result with -3:

-28 * -3 = 84

Finally, multiply that result with 3:

84 * 3 = 252

So the full expression simplifies to 28 * 252.

For the first part: (5 + 3 - 6 + 1)
- Start with 5.

1. Start with (1 + 0 - 3 + 0).
   - Adding 1 and 0 gives 1.
   - Subtracting 3 from 1 gives -2.
   - Adding another 0 doesn't change anything.

((5 * -3 * 3 * 7) * (0 + -9 - -5 - -2))","{""ANSWER"": ""INTEGER""}",,"Let's solve this step by step.

The expression is ((5 * -3 * 3 * 7) * (0 + -9 - -5 - -2)). First, I need to evaluate the multiplication part inside the first set of parentheses and then the addition/subtraction in the second set.

Starting with the first part: 5 * -3 * 3 * 7.
- Multiply 5 by -3: 5 * (-3) = -15.
- Then multiply -15 by 3: -15 * 3 = -45.
- Finally, multiply -45 by 7: -45 * 7 = -315.

So, the first part evaluates to -315.

Now, let's evaluate the second part: 0 + -9 - -5 - -2.
- The plus sign (+) for zero doesn't change the value, so it remains 0.
- Next, add -9: 0 + (-9) = -9.
- Then subtract -5, which is the same as adding 5: -9 + 5 = -4.
- Finally, subtract -2, which is the same as adding 2: -4 + 2 = -2.

So, the second part evaluates to -2.

Now, we need to multiply the results from both parts: -315 * -2.
- Multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result: -315 * -2 = 630.

Since the problem asks for an integer answer, and 630 is an integer, the final answer is 630.

First, let's simplify inside the parentheses. Start with the first part: (8 - 3 + 0 + 7).

Calculate 8 - 3 = 5.
Then add 0 (no change), so it's still 5.
Next, add 7, which gives us 5 + 7 = 12.

So far, we have 12 from the first part of the expression.

Now, let's look at the second part: (-9 * -6 * 2 - 0). Since there's no operation between the multiplication and the subtraction, I'll just do the multiplication first.

(-9) * (-6) = 54 (because negative times negative is positive).
Then multiply that result by 2: 54 * 2 = 108.

Finally, subtract 0, which doesn't change the number.

So now we have 108 in the second part of the expression.

Adding these two parts together: 12 + 108 = 120.

The question asks if the answer is an integer. Since 120 is an integer, the answer is indeed an integer. So the final answer is {""ANSWER"": $INTEGER}.",,2025-05-10 23:22:54

((-2 * 9 * -8 + 8) - (0 * -4 - (-6 * 4)))

First, I need to handle the operations inside the parentheses.

Step 1: Calculate the first part of the expression:
(-2 * 9 * -8 + 8)

(-2 * 9 = -18)
(-18 * -8 = 144)
(144 + 8 = 152)

So, the first part simplifies to 152.

Step 2: Calculate the second part of the expression:
(0 * -4 - (-6 * 4))

(0 * -4 = 0)
(-6 * 4 = -24)
(0 - (-24) = 0 + 24 = 24)

So, the second part simplifies to 24.

Now, we have:

152 - 24

Finally, subtracting these two results:

152 - 24 = 128

The answer is 128, which is an integer.

First, I know that any number multiplied by zero is zero, so let's simplify the first part inside the parentheses: (-7 * -6 * 0 - 5). Since the product of -7 and -6 is positive 42 (because negative times negative is positive), then multiplying by zero makes it zero. So, the first part becomes (-5). Now the expression looks like: (-5 * (-3 - 9 * -8 * -9)).

Next, we need to evaluate the innermost part of the second set of parentheses, which is (-9 * -8 * -9). When you multiply three negative numbers together, the result is negative. Let's calculate each part: -9 * -8 = 72 (positive because two negatives make a positive), and then 72 * -9 = -648 (negative again).

So now the expression is: (-5 * (-3 - (-648))). Simplifying inside the parentheses: -3 + 648 = 645. Therefore, the expression simplifies to: (-5 * 645).

1. 3 * 8 = 24
2. Then 24 * -1 = -24
3. Finally, -24 * -9 = 216

So, the first part of the expression simplifies to 216.

Now let's move on to the second part: (-2 + 2 * -8 * 8).

First, multiply 2 and -8:
-2 * -8 = 16

Then multiply that result by 8:
16 * 8 = 128

So, the expression becomes:

-2 + 128 = 126

Now we have the simplified expression as (216 - 126).

First, let's handle the expressions inside the parentheses separately:

1. For the first part: (-9 + 5 * 0 - -8)
   Inside the parentheses, there's multiplication and subtraction:
   -9 + 0 + 8 (since 5 * 0 = 0)
   So, -9 + 8 = -1

2. For the second part: (6 - -5 * -7 + -8)
   Again, there's multiplication:
   -5 * -7 = 35 (negative times negative gives positive)
   Now we have: 6 + 35 - 8

The expression is: ((-2 - (-7) - 5 * 2) + (-3 - 5 * 3 + (-7)))

First, I need to simplify the terms inside the parentheses. Let's start with the first part: (-2 - (-7) - 5 * 2).

Inside the first set of parentheses:
1. Simplify -(-7): This is just +7 because subtracting a negative is like adding.
2. Now we have (-2 + 7 - 5 * 2).
3. Next, do the multiplication: 5 * 2 = 10.
4. So now it's (-2 + 7 - 10).
5. Simplifying further: -2 + 7 = 5, and then 5 - 10 = -5.

So the first part simplifies to -5.

Now let's look at the second part: (-3 - 5 * 3 + (-7)).

1. Do the multiplication: 5 * 3 = 15.
2. So it becomes (-3 - 15 + (-7)).
3. Simplifying: -3 - 15 = -18, then -18 - 7 = -25.

So the second part simplifies to -25.

Now we combine the simplified parts from both sets of parentheses: -5 + (-25).

Since adding a negative is like subtracting, -5 + (-25) = -5 - 25 = -30.

The final answer is -30. Since the instruction says to return ""INTEGER"" for the answer, the JSON should be {""ANSWER"": -30}. 

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure there were no mistakes:

First, let me simplify the terms inside the parentheses.

In the first part, (-9 + -7 + -1 - -1), we need to handle the subtraction of a negative number. Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive counterpart. So:

-9 + -7 + -1 + 1

Now, let's add these numbers together:

-9 - 7 - 1 + 1 = -16

So, the first part simplifies to -16.

Next, let's look at the second part of the expression: (3 - -7 - -1 * 0).

Again, subtracting a negative is like adding a positive, so:

3 + 7 - 0

Now, since anything multiplied by zero is zero, -1 * 0 = 0. So the expression further simplifies to:

3 + 7 = 10

Now we have the simplified expression: (-16 * 10). 

Multiplying these two numbers gives:

-160

Calculate it step-by-step:
-1 + 6 = 5
5 + 9 = 14
14 + 3 = 17

So, (-1 + 6 + 9 + 3) = 17

Next, for the second part: (-5 - 9 - -3 + 4)

Again, let's break it down:
-5 - 9 = -14 (since subtracting a negative is like adding)
-14 - -3 = -14 + 3 = -11 (subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding)

1. The first part is (-7 + 9 * 9 * 6)
   - Inside that, we have multiplication before addition according to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division from left to right, Addition/Subtraction from left to right).

2. The second part is (-2 - -5 + 9 + -7)

Let's start with the first part: (-7 + 9 * 9 * 6)

Multiplication comes before addition:
- First, calculate 9 * 9 = 81
- Then, 81 * 6 = 486

So, the expression becomes (-7 + 486)

Now add -7 and 486:
-7 + 486 = 479

So now we have: 479 - (-2 - -5 + 9 + -7)

Next, let's simplify the second part: (-2 - -5 + 9 + -7)

- Subtracting a negative is like adding, so -(-5) becomes +5.
- So the expression becomes: -2 + 5 + 9 - 7

- -2 + 5 = 3
- 3 + 9 = 12

The minus sign in front of a negative number turns it into addition. So, -(-8) becomes +8 and -(-7) becomes +7.
So, the expression becomes (8 - 4 + 8 + 7).

Now let's do the arithmetic inside:

Now, the original expression becomes:

(-2) * (-6)

Multiplying these two numbers:

-2 * -6 = 12

So, the final answer is 12.

((1 * 5 * -8 - -2) * (-2 * 6 - -5 * 3))","{""ANSWER"": -INTEGER}",,"Let's solve this step by step to find the correct answer.

The expression given is:

((1 * 5 * -8 - -2) * (-2 * 6 - -5 * 3))

First, let's break it down into two parts and solve each part separately before multiplying them together.

Part 1: (1 * 5 * -8 - -2)
- Calculate 1 * 5 = 5.
- Then, 5 * -8 = -40.
- Now, subtract -2 from -40. Subtracting a negative number is like adding its positive counterpart, so -40 - (-2) becomes -40 + 2 = -38.

So, Part 1 simplifies to -38.

Part 2: (-2 * 6 - -5 * 3)
- Calculate -2 * 6 = -12.
- Next, calculate -5 * 3 = -15.
- Then, subtract -15 from -12. Again, subtracting a negative is adding the positive value, so -12 - (-15) becomes -12 + 15 = 3.

So, Part 2 simplifies to 3.

Now, multiply the results of the two parts: -38 * 3.

When you multiply -38 by 3, you get -114.

So, the final answer is -114. The problem asks for an integer answer, which -114 certainly is.

((-8 - -1 * -8 * -2) * (-6 + 8 + -5 * -8))","{""ANSWER"": INTEGER}",,"Let's try to solve this step by step.

The given expression is:

((-8 - (-1 * -8 * -2)) * (-6 + 8 + (-5 * -8)))

First, let's handle the innermost parentheses and multiplication.

For the first part, inside the first set of parentheses:

-8 - (-1 * -8 * -2)

We need to calculate the product of the numbers inside the parentheses first:

(-1 * -8 * -2)

Multiplication rules for negative numbers: (-1) * (-8) = 8 (positive because two negatives make a positive), then multiply that by -2:

8 * (-2) = -16

Now substitute back into the original expression:

(-8 - (-16))

Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive value:

-8 + 16 = 8

So now we have:

(8) * (-6 + 8 + (-5 * -8))

Next, let's simplify the second part of the expression in the parentheses:

-6 + 8 + (-5 * -8)

Calculate the product:

-5 * -8 = 40 (since two negatives make a positive)

Now substitute back into the expression:

-6 + 8 + 40

Simplify this:

-6 + 8 = 2
2 + 40 = 42

So now we have:

8 * 42

Finally, multiply these values:

8 * 42 = 336

So the final answer is 336.

The given expression is:

((4 - (-6) + (-9) + (-7)) - (9 + (-3) - (-7) * (-8)))

First, let's simplify inside the parentheses.

For the first part: 4 - (-6) + (-9) + (-7)

- Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:
  4 + 6 - 9 - 7

Now add and subtract from left to right:

4 + 6 = 10
10 - 9 = 1
1 - 7 = -6

So the first part simplifies to -6.

Now for the second part: 9 + (-3) - (-7) * (-8)

Again, subtracting a negative adds, and multiplying two negatives gives a positive:
9 - 3 + 7 * 8

Perform the multiplication next:
7 * 8 = 56

So now we have:
9 - 3 + 56

Do the additions and subtractions from left to right:
9 - 3 = 6
6 + 56 = 62

So the second part simplifies to 62.

Now we need to subtract the second result from the first:

-6 - 62

This gives us:
-6 - 62 = -68

So the final answer is -68. 

The integer form of -68 is simply -68, which is an integer.

First, let's simplify inside the parentheses. Starting with the first part:

1. Calculate 0 * -7.
   0 times any number is 0, so that equals 0.

2. Now, calculate -6 * 3.
   -6 times 3 is -18.

So, the first part of the expression becomes (0 - 18), which simplifies to -18.

Next, let's handle the second part inside the parentheses:

1. Calculate -9 + -5.
   -9 plus -5 is -14.

2. Then, calculate -2 * -1.
   Negative two times negative one is positive two.

Now add these results together: -14 + 2 = -12.

So, the second part of the expression simplifies to -12.

Now we have the full expression as (-18) * (-12).

Multiplying -18 by -12 gives us a positive result because the product of two negative numbers is positive.

-18 * -12 = 216.

Since the problem asks for an ""INTEGER"" answer, and 216 is indeed an integer, the final answer is 216.

The expression is: 

((-8 * 1 * -1 + -5) + (-2 - -3 + 1 * -7))

First, let's simplify inside the parentheses.

Step 1: Calculate the multiplication and addition inside the first set of parentheses.

(-8 * 1 * -1) + (-5)

-8 times 1 is -8, and then -8 times -1 equals 8 (negative times negative gives positive). So:

8 + (-5) = 3

So now the expression becomes:

(3 + (-2 - -3 + 1 * -7))

Next, calculate the operations inside the second set of parentheses.

(-2 - -3) + (1 * -7)

-2 minus -3 is the same as adding 3, so:

-2 + 3 = 1

Then multiply 1 by -7:

1 * -7 = -7

Now the expression looks like this:

(3 + (1 - 7))

Next, perform the subtraction in the second set of parentheses:

1 - 7 = -6

So the expression now is:

(3 + (-6))

Finally, add these numbers together:

3 + (-6) = -3

So the final answer is -3.

1. Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:
   (8 - -9 * 4 * 9)
   Inside the parentheses, there's an operation involving subtraction and multiplication. According to the rules, I need to perform the multiplication before subtraction. So I'll calculate -9 * 4 * 9 first.
   
   -9 * 4 = -36
   -36 * 9 = -324
   
   Now subtracting -324 from 8. Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart, so it becomes:
   8 + 324 = 332
   
   So, the expression simplifies to (332 * (-4 * -3 * 7 * 9))

2. Next, evaluate the second set of parentheses:
   -4 * -3 = 12 (negative times negative equals positive)
   12 * 7 = 84 (multiplying 12 by 7)
   84 * 9 = 756 (multiplying 84 by 9)

So the expression now is (332 * 756).

3. Finally, multiply these two numbers together:

1 * -9 = -9

So the expression becomes:

((-9 - 4 + -9) + (-1 + -6 + 9 - 5))

Next, we need to evaluate the operations inside each set of parentheses separately. Starting with the first set:

-9 - 4 + -9

Calculate from left to right:

-9 - 4 = -13

Then add -9:

-13 + -9 = -22

So the first part simplifies to -22.

Now for the second set:

-1 + -6 + 9 - 5

Again, calculate step-by-step:

-1 + -6 = -7

-7 + 9 = 2

2 - 5 = -3

So the second part simplifies to -3.

For the first part: (-1 + 2 - 9 + 0)

Calculate it step-by-step:

1 - 9 = -8
-8 + 0 = -8

So, the first part simplifies to -8.

Now for the second part: (0 - (-2) + (-6) - 2)

Again, let's break it down:
-0 + 2 = 2 (since subtracting a negative is like adding)
2 + (-6) = -4 (adding a negative number)
-4 - 2 = -6

So, the second part simplifies to -6.

Now we multiply the two simplified parts together: (-8) * (-6)

Starting with the first part: 7 * -5 * -9 + 7.

First, calculate 7 * -5, which equals -35. Then, multiply that result by -9, so -35 * -9 = 315. Adding 7 to that gives 315 + 7 = 322.

Now, let's move to the second part: 2 + -8 * 6 * 3.

Calculate -8 * 6, which is -48. Then multiply that by 3, giving -144. Adding 2 to -144 results in -142.

So now we have 322 - (-142).

Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart, so it becomes 322 + 142 = 464.
