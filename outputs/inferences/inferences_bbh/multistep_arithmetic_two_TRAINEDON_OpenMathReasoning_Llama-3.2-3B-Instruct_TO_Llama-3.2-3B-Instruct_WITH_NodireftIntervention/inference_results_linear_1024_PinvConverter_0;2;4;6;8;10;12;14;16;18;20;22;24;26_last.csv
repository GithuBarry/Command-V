First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right, then addition and subtraction from left to right. This is known as PEMDAS.

So, let's start with the expressions inside the parentheses:

1. (-1 + 2 + 9 * 5)
2. (-2 + -4 + -4 * -7)

First, calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses:

1. 9 * 5 = 45
2. -4 * -7 = 28

Then, calculate the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses:

1. (-1 + 2) = 1
2. (1 + 45) = 46
3. (-2 + -4) = -6
4. (-6 + 28) = 22

Now, subtract the second result from the first result:

46 - 22 = 24

First, let's calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses: -9 * -5, -6 * -3 * 1.

-9 * -5 = 45 (since multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result)

Now, let's calculate the additions and subtractions inside the parentheses:

-9 * -5 - 6 + -2 = 45 - 6 + (-2) = 45 - 6 - 2 = 37

-8 - -6 * -3 * 1 = -8 - 18 = -26

First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Calculate the expressions inside the parentheses.
2. Evaluate any exponents (none in this case).
3. Perform any multiplication and division from left to right.
4. Perform any addition and subtraction from left to right.

So, let's start with the innermost parentheses:

-5 * -9 = 45

So the equation becomes:

((5 * -8 - 45) * (2 - -7 * 6 - 4))

Now, calculate the next set of parentheses:

-7 * 6 = -42

So the equation becomes:

((5 * -8 - 45) * (2 - (-42) - 4))

Next, calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses:

5 * -8 = -40

So the equation becomes:

((-40 - 45) * (2 + 42 - 4))

Next, calculate the addition inside the parentheses:

2 + 42 - 4 = 40

So the equation becomes:

((-40 - 45) * 40)

Next, calculate the subtraction inside the parentheses:

-40 - 45 = -85

((6 + 1 - 4 - 3) - (-4 * -6 * -3 + 1))","{""ANSWER"": 0}",,"Let's break down the expression step by step.

First, we have the expression inside the parentheses: (6 + 1 - 4 - 3). Let's calculate it from left to right.

6 + 1 = 7
7 - 4 = 3
3 - 3 = 0

So the expression inside the parentheses simplifies to 0.

Next, we have the expression: (-4 * -6 * -3 + 1). To calculate this, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Multiply -4 and -6: -4 * -6 = 24
2. Multiply 24 by -3: 24 * -3 = -72
3. Add 1: -72 + 1 = -71

So the expression (-4 * -6 * -3 + 1) simplifies to -71.

Now, we have the expression: (6 + 1 - 4 - 3) - (-4 * -6 * -3 + 1). We already know that the first expression inside the parentheses simplifies to 0, so we can rewrite it as 0 - (-71 + 1).

Let's simplify the second part of the expression: -71 + 1 = -70.

Now we have: 0 - (-70).

When you subtract a negative number, it's equivalent to adding the positive value. So 0 - (-70) is the same as 0 + 70.

0 + 70 = 70.

1. Parentheses/Brackets
2. Exponents/Orders (none in this case)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

The given expression is: ((9 - 3 + 2 + -1) - (5 - -1 - -6 * -4))

Step 1: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses.

Inside the first set of parentheses: 9 - 3 + 2 + -1

- 9 - 3 = 6
- 6 + 2 = 8
- 8 + -1 = 7

So, the first set of parentheses evaluates to 7.

Inside the second set of parentheses: 5 - -1 - -6 * -4

- -1 - -6 = 5

1. Multiply 6 and -2: 6 * -2 = -12
2. Add -8 and -12: -8 + -12 = -20
3. Add 4 to -20: -20 + 4 = -16

So, the expression inside the first parentheses evaluates to -16.

Next, we have the expression inside the second parentheses: (-4 * 5 + 2 - 8). 

Following the order of operations again:

1. Multiply -4 and 5: -4 * 5 = -20
2. Add 2 to -20: -20 + 2 = -18
3. Subtract 8 from -18: -18 - 8 = -26

So, the expression inside the second parentheses evaluates to -26.

Now, we multiply the results of both expressions: (-16) * (-26).

To multiply two negative numbers, we multiply the absolute values and then apply the negative sign. The absolute value of -16 is 16 and the absolute value of -26 is 26. 

16 * 26 = 416

Since both numbers are negative, we apply the negative sign: -416

So, let's start with the multiplication operations:

-1 * 7 * -6

Multiplication of -1 and 7 is -7. Then multiplying -7 by -6 gives 42.

Now, let's look at the second multiplication operation:

-7 * -1

Multiplying -7 and -1 gives 7.

Next, we'll add and subtract the numbers:

-5 + -3

-5 + -3 equals -8.

Now, let's put it all together:

(3 + 42) - (7 + (-8))

For the second expression: (7 + -1 + -3 * -2)
- -3 * -2 = 6 (because multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive number)
- 7 + -1 = 6 (because adding a negative number to a positive number gives the difference between the two numbers)
- 6 + 6 = 12 (because adding two positive numbers gives the sum of the two numbers)
So, the second expression equals 12.

Now, let's subtract the second expression from the first expression:
-8 - 12 = -20

Therefore, the final answer is -20.

Next, we calculate the expression inside the first parentheses: 4 - (-9)

To subtract a negative number, we can add the number instead. So, 4 - (-9) becomes 4 + 9.

So, the given expression is: (-2 - 2 * 2 + 0) - (7 - 6 - -7 - -1)

Step 1: Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses.

Inside the first parentheses: -2 - 2 * 2 + 0

First, we multiply 2 by 2: 2 * 2 = 4

Then, we subtract 4 from -2: -2 - 4 = -6

Next, we add 0 to -6: -6 + 0 = -6

So, the first parentheses evaluate to -6.

Inside the second parentheses: 7 - 6 - -7 - -1

First, we subtract -6 from 7: 7 - (-6) = 7 + 6 = 13

Then, we subtract -7 from 13: 13 - (-7) = 13 + 7 = 20

Next, we subtract -1 from 20: 20 - (-1) = 20 + 1 = 21

So, the second parentheses evaluate to 21.

Step 2: Now we can rewrite the expression with the evaluated parentheses:

-6 - 21

Step 3: Finally, we subtract 21 from -6:

-6 - 21 = -27

Now we have: 54 - (-3)

To subtract a negative number, we actually add the positive value, so this becomes: 54 + 3 = 57

Now we have the two sides of the subtraction sign: 0 and 57.

Subtracting 0 from any number leaves the number unchanged, so the final result is: 57

The first set of parentheses is (-2 * -1 + 1 * -3). 

-2 * -1 = 2
1 * -3 = -3

First, we need to evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses. 

The first expression is (-2 - 1 - -6 + -9). Let's calculate it from left to right:

1. -2 - 1 = -3
2. -3 + -6 = -9
3. -9 + -9 = -18

So, the first expression equals -18.

The second expression is (4 * 8 + -8 * 5). Again, let's calculate it from left to right:

1. 4 * 8 = 32
2. -8 * 5 = -40
3. 32 + -40 = -8

So, the second expression equals -8.

Now, we subtract the second expression from the first expression: -18 - (-8). 

When subtracting a negative number, we can add the absolute value of that number instead. So, -18 - (-8) becomes -18 + 8.

-18 + 8 = -10.

1 - 8 + 0 + 3

Now, let's perform the subtractions and additions from left to right.

1 - 8 = -7
-7 + 0 = -7

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is also known as PEMDAS.

Given the problem:
((-7 + 9 + -9 * -4) - (-7 * 6 - 7 * 3))

Step 1: Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses.

-7 + 9 = 2
-9 * -4 = 36
So, (-7 + 9 + -9 * -4) = 2 + 36 = 38

-7 * 6 = -42
-7 * 3 = -21
So, (-7 * 6 - 7 * 3) = -42 - 21 = -63

Now, the equation becomes:
(38) - (-63)

Step 2: Evaluate the subtraction of a negative number, which is equivalent to adding the absolute value of that number.

38 - (-63) = 38 + 63 = 101

So, the answer is 101.

So, the sum inside the parentheses is -13.

Next, we need to calculate the product inside the parentheses: (-4 * 2 + -5 * 8)

First, let's calculate the products:

Now, we add the two products together: -8 + -40 = -48

Now we can put the two parts of the equation together: (-13) + (-48)

First, we add -13 and -48. To do this, we can add their absolute values and then subtract the smaller from the larger: |-13| + |-48| = 13 + 48 = 61. Then, we subtract the smaller from the larger: 61 - 13 = 48. Since both numbers are negative, we subtract their absolute values: 48 - 13 = 35.

First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means we should evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses first.

Inside the first set of parentheses, we have: -4 + 5 - 4 - (-6)

To calculate this, we need to handle the negative sign first. When we have a negative sign in front of a number, it means we need to negate that number. So, -(-6) is equal to 6.

Now, we can calculate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: -4 + 5 - 4 + 6

Performing the addition and subtraction from left to right: -4 + 5 = 1, 1 - 4 = -3, -3 + 6 = 3.

So, the first set of parentheses evaluates to 3.

So, the first parentheses evaluate to -48.

Next, let's calculate the expression inside the second parentheses: 0 - 4 - 0 - -9.

First, subtracting -9 is equivalent to adding 9, so the expression becomes 0 - 4 + 9.

Then, 0 minus 4 is -4, and -4 plus 9 is 5.

So, the second parentheses evaluate to 5.

Now, we multiply the results of the two parentheses: -48 * 5.

Multiplying -48 by 5 gives us -240.

Therefore, the answer is -240.

Then, 4 + (-9) = 4 - 9 = -5.

Finally, -5 + (-2) = -5 - 2 = -7.

Now we have the two expressions: (-9) and (-7).

So, -5 - 9 + -3 + 4 = -13.

Now, let's put the results back into the original equation:

17 - (-13)

When subtracting a negative number, it's the same as adding the positive of that number. So, -(-13) is the same as +13.

17 + 13 = 30

First, calculate the multiplication: 9 * 9 * 6. 

9 * 9 = 81
81 * 6 = 486

So, 9 * 9 * 6 = 486.

Now, calculate the other part of the equation inside the parentheses: -2 - -5 + 9 + -7.

First, - -5 is the same as +5, so -2 - -5 = -2 + 5 = 3.

Then, add 9: 3 + 9 = 12.

Finally, add -7: 12 + (-7) = 12 - 7 = 5.

So, -2 - -5 + 9 + -7 = 5.

Now, substitute these values back into the original equation: (-7 + 486) - 5.

First, calculate the sum inside the parentheses: -7 + 486. 

-7 + 486 = 479.
