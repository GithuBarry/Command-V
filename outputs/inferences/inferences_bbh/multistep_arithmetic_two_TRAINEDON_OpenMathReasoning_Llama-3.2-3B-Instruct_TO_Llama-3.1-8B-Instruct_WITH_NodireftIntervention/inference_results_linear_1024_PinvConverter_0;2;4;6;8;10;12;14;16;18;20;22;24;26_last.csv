First, we need to calculate the expressions inside the parentheses.

Inside the first parentheses: 6 - 1 - (-3) + (-2)

We know that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number. So, - (-3) is the same as + 3.

6 - 1 + 3 - 2 = 6

Inside the second parentheses: 5 * 5 + (-1) - (-8)

We know that multiplying a number by a negative number is the same as multiplying the number by -1.

5 * 5 = 25

25 + (-1) - (-8) is the same as 25 - 1 + 8

25 - 1 + 8 = 32

-6 - (-6) = -6 + 6 = 0
0 - 5 = -5

Now, let's substitute the values back into the original equation:

(-4 + 4 + 3 * 1) - (-9 - -3 + -6 - 5) = 3 - (-5)

1. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:
   (3 - 2 - 3 * 3) = (1 - 3 * 3) = (1 - 9) = -8

2. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
   (-8 * -1 * -9 * 3) = (-8 * -1 * -27) = (8 * -1 * -27) = (-216)

3. Now, we can add the two expressions together:
   (-8) + (-216) = -224

So the answer is -224.

First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:
   - 8 * -6 * -1 = 48

2. Replace the evaluated expression in the original equation:
   ((6 - 5 + 5 + -9) - (9 + 48))

3. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:
   - 6 - 5 + 5 + -9 = -3
   - 9 + 48 = 57

4. Replace the evaluated expressions in the original equation:
   -3 - 57

5. Evaluate the final expression:

The expression given is ((8 * 3 - -1 - -3) * (-4 * 7 * -3 * 3))

First, let's simplify the inner brackets: 

(8 * 3 - -1 - -3) = (24 + 1 + 3) = 28

Now, let's simplify the outer brackets: 

(-4 * 7 * -3 * 3) = (-4 * -21 * 3) = (84 * 3) = 252

((-8 - -7 + 0 + 3) + (-3 + 5 - (-5 * -8)))

First, solve the expression inside the parentheses on the right side:
(-3 + 5 - (-5 * -8))

First, solve the multiplication:
(-5 * -8) = 40

Now, replace the multiplication with its result:
(-3 + 5 - 40)

Next, solve the addition and subtraction from left to right:
(-3 + 5) = 2
(2 - 40) = -38

Now, replace the right side of the expression with its result:
((-8 - -7 + 0 + 3) + (-38))

Next, solve the expression inside the parentheses on the left side:
((-8 - -7 + 0 + 3))

First, solve the subtraction:
(-8 - -7) = -1

Now, replace the subtraction with its result:
(-1 + 0 + 3)

Next, solve the addition and subtraction from left to right:
(-1 + 0) = -1
(-1 + 3) = 2

Now, replace the left side of the expression with its result:
(2 + (-38))

Finally, solve the addition:
