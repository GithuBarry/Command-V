-6 remains the same

2. Now, substitute the values back into the original expression:
-14 - (-84 - 6)

3. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
-84 - 6 = -90

4. Now, substitute the value back into the original expression:
-14 - (-90)

5. To subtract a negative number, we add its absolute value:
-14 + 90 = 76

2. Now, let's rewrite the expression with the evaluated expressions:
   (-7 + (-11) * (-24 - 2 - 3))

3. Evaluate the expressions inside the second set of parentheses:
   - (-24 - 2 - 3) = -24 - 2 - 3 = -29

4. Now, let's rewrite the expression with the evaluated expressions:
   (-7 + (-11) * (-29))

5. Multiply (-11) and (-29):
   - (-11) * (-29) = -11 * 29 = -319

6. Now, let's rewrite the expression with the evaluated expression:
   (-7 + (-319))

7. Finally, add (-7) and (-319):
   -7 + (-319) = -7 - 319 = -326
