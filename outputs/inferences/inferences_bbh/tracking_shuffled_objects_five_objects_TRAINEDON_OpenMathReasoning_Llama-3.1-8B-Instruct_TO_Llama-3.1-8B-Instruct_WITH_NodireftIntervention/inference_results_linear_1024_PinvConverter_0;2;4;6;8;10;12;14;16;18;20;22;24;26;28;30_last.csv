6. Gertrude and Fred swap balls. So Gertrude now has Fred's purple ball, and Fred has Gertrude's orange ball.
7. Alice and Fred swap balls. So Alice now has Fred's orange ball, and Fred has Alice's black ball.

Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are on the same team in a soccer match. At the start of the match, they are each assigned to a position: Alice is playing left midfielder, Bob is playing cheerleader, Claire is playing right midfielder, Dave is playing center midfielder, Eve is playing goalkeeper, Fred is playing striker, and Gertrude is playing benchwarmer.
As the game progresses, pairs of players occasionally swap positions. First, Dave and Bob trade positions. Then, Alice and Eve trade positions. Then, Claire and Gertrude trade positions. Then, Fred and Alice trade positions. Then, Bob and Claire trade positions. Then, Dave and Eve trade positions. Finally, Bob and Alice trade positions. At the end of the match, Fred is playing

(B) cheerleader
(C) right midfielder
(D) center midfielder
(E) goalkeeper
(F) striker
(G) benchwarmer","{""ANSWER"": ""F""}",," let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. Initially, Alice is left midfielder, Bob is cheerleader, Claire is right midfielder, Dave is center midfielder, Eve is goalkeeper, Fred is striker, and Gertrude is benchwarmer.

2. First, Dave and Bob trade positions. So, Dave is now cheerleader, and Bob is center midfielder.

3. Then, Alice and Eve trade positions. So, Alice is now goalkeeper, and Eve is left midfielder.

4. Next, Claire and Gertrude trade positions. So, Claire is now benchwarmer, and Gertrude is right midfielder.

5. After that, Fred and Alice trade positions. So, Fred is now left midfielder, and Alice is striker.

6. Then, Bob and Claire trade positions. So, Bob is now benchwarmer, and Claire is cheerleader.

7. Then, Dave and Eve trade positions. So, Dave is now goalkeeper, and Eve is center midfielder.

8. Finally, Bob and Alice trade positions. So, Bob is now striker, and Alice is cheerleader.

Now, we need to find out where Fred is at the end of the match. Let's see what happened to Fred. Initially, Fred was striker. After the first trade, Fred and Alice traded positions, so Fred became left midfielder. Then, Fred and Alice traded positions again, so Fred became striker. But after that, Bob and Alice traded positions, so Alice became cheerleader, and Bob became striker. Since Bob became striker, Fred is not striker anymore.

So, Fred was left midfielder after the first trade, but then he became striker after the second trade, and then he became striker again after the last trade. However, we need to check if there were any other trades that might have affected Fred's position.

From the trades, we can see that Fred's position was only affected by the first and second trades. The third trade involved Claire and Gertrude, the fourth trade involved Fred and Alice, the fifth trade involved Bob and Claire, the sixth trade involved Dave and Eve, and the seventh trade involved Bob and Alice.

Since Fred's position was only affected by the first and second trades, we can conclude that Fred is left midfielder.

3. Then, Claire and Alice switch partners.

But we know Claire should be with Sam, and Alice should be with Sam after the first switch, so this switch actually makes no change, Claire is still with Ophelia, and Alice is still with Lola.

4. Then, Fred and Dave switch partners. So now, Fred is dancing with Sam, and Dave is dancing with Patrick.

5. Then, Eve and Fred switch partners. So now, Eve is dancing with Sam, and Fred is dancing with Patrick (which is actually the wrong partner, Fred should be with Sam), but since we know that Eve is dancing with Sam from the last switch, Eve is actually dancing with Sam, and Fred is actually dancing with Patrick. But we know Fred should be with Sam, and Eve should be with Sam after the last switch, so this switch actually makes no change, Eve is still with Melissa, and Fred is still with Patrick.

7. Then, Alice and Eve switch partners. So now, Alice is dancing with Melissa, and Eve is dancing with Lola.

8. Finally, Gertrude and Bob switch partners. This doesn't affect Dave's partner, so Dave is still dancing with the same person.

Let's go back to step 2. We know that Alice and Dave switched partners. So Dave is now dancing with Sam. But in step 6, we know that Alice and Eve switched partners, so Alice is now dancing with Melissa, and Eve is dancing with Lola. This means that Dave is still dancing with Sam, but we don't know if Dave is still dancing with Sam after step 6.

Let's go back to step 3. We know that Claire and Alice switched partners, but this actually makes no change, Claire is still with Ophelia, and Alice is still with Lola. But we know Claire should be with Sam, and Alice should be with Sam after the first switch, so this switch actually makes no change, Claire is still with Ophelia, and Alice is still with Lola.

Let's go back to step 4. We know that Fred and Dave switched partners. So now, Fred is dancing with Sam, and Dave is dancing with Patrick.

Let's go back to step 5. We know that Eve and Fred switched partners, but this actually makes no change, Eve is still with Melissa, and Fred is still with Patrick.

Let's go back to step 6. We know that Claire and Fred switched partners. So now, Claire is dancing with Patrick, and Fred is dancing with Ophelia.

Let's go back to step 7. We know that Alice and Eve switched partners. So now, Alice is dancing with Melissa, and Eve is dancing with Lola.

Now let's go back to the end. We know that Dave is dancing with Sam after the first switch, but then Fred and Dave switched partners. So now, Dave is dancing with Patrick. But then Alice and Eve switched partners, so Dave is still dancing with Patrick.

Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are on the same team in a soccer match. At the start of the match, they are each assigned to a position: Alice is playing striker, Bob is playing right winger, Claire is playing left winger, Dave is playing benchwarmer, Eve is playing goalkeeper, Fred is playing center midfielder, and Gertrude is playing cheerleader.
As the game progresses, pairs of players occasionally swap positions. First, Eve and Claire trade positions. Then, Gertrude and Alice trade positions. Then, Fred and Bob trade positions. Then, Dave and Fred trade positions. Then, Fred and Bob trade positions. Then, Bob and Eve trade positions. Finally, Claire and Alice trade positions. At the end of the match, Dave is playing

(A) striker
(B) right winger
(C) left winger
(D) benchwarmer
(E) goalkeeper
(F) center midfielder
(G) cheerleader","{
  ""ANSWER"": ""D""
}",," let's analyze the position swaps step by step:

1. Eve and Claire trade positions.
   - Eve is now playing left winger (Claire's original position).
   - Claire is now playing goalkeeper (Eve's original position).

2. Gertrude and Alice trade positions.
   - Gertrude is now playing striker (Alice's original position).
   - Alice is now playing cheerleader (Gertrude's original position).

3. Fred and Bob trade positions.
   - Fred is now playing right winger (Bob's original position).
   - Bob is now playing center midfielder (Fred's original position).

4. Dave and Fred trade positions.
   - Dave is now playing center midfielder (Fred's original position).
   - Fred is now playing benchwarmer (Dave's original position).

5. Fred and Bob trade positions again.
   - This swap is unnecessary since it's the same swap as step 3. It doesn't change the positions.

6. Bob and Eve trade positions.
   - Bob is now playing left winger (Eve's current position).
   - Eve is now playing center midfielder (Bob's current position).

7. Claire and Alice trade positions.
   - Claire is now playing striker (Alice's current position).
   - Alice is now playing goalkeeper (Claire's current position).

Now, let's find Dave's position at the end of the match. Initially, Dave was playing benchwarmer. After the swaps, he traded positions with Fred twice, but then Fred traded positions with Bob and Eve. Dave's position remained the same, benchwarmer, after the swap with Fred. However, after the swap with Bob and Eve, Bob took Dave's original position, but since Dave was playing benchwarmer, and Fred took Bob's position, Dave is still playing benchwarmer.

1. Initially, Bob is dancing with Izzi. Then Alice and Bob switch partners. This means Alice is now with Izzi, and Bob is with Alice's original partner, which is Karl.
2. Next, Eve and Gertrude switch partners. Eve was with Rodrigo, so now Eve is with Patrick (Gertrude's original partner), and Gertrude is with Rodrigo.
3. Claire and Gertrude switch partners. Claire was with Melissa, so now Claire is with Rodrigo (Gertrude's current partner), and Gertrude is with Melissa.
4. Then, Gertrude and Bob switch partners. Gertrude was with Melissa, so now Gertrude is with Karl (Bob's current partner), and Bob is with Melissa.
5. Next, Claire and Bob switch partners. Claire was with Rodrigo, so now Claire is with Melissa again (her original partner), and Bob is with Rodrigo.
6. Then, Fred and Gertrude switch partners. Fred was with Helga, so now Fred is with Melissa (Gertrude's current partner), and Gertrude is with Helga.
7. Finally, Claire and Dave switch partners. Claire was with Melissa, so now Claire is with Lola (Dave's original partner), and Dave is with Melissa.

Now, let's see where Bob ends up. After step 4, Bob was with Melissa. Then in step 5, Bob switched with Claire and ended up with Rodrigo. In step 6, Gertrude switched with Fred, but that doesn't affect Bob. Finally, in step 7, Claire and Dave switched partners, but that also doesn't affect Bob. So, at the end of the dance, Bob is still with Rodrigo.

1. Eve and Bob trade positions. So, Eve is now on the bench, and Bob is on the left wing.
2. Fred and Claire trade positions. So, Fred is now on the right midfield, and Claire is in goal.
3. Bob and Fred trade positions. So, Bob is now in goal, and Fred is back to being the goalkeeper.

6. Dave and Gertrude trade positions. So, Dave is now on the cheerleading position, and Gertrude is on the striker position.
7. Claire and Gertrude trade positions. So, Claire is now on the cheerleading position, and Gertrude is back to being the striker.

Now, we know that Dave swapped positions with Gertrude, and Gertrude was on the striker position after that swap. Before that, Gertrude was on the cheerleading position. Before that, Dave was on the cheerleading position. Before that, Dave was on the striker position, but he swapped with Gertrude, so he must have been on the cheerleading position before that swap.

- Claire has a red present
- Alice has a green present

Then, Claire and Dave swap gifts:

- Claire has a pink ball
- Dave has a green present

Now, Bob and Dave swap gifts:

- Bob has a green present
- Dave has a purple present

Finally, Alice and Eve swap gifts:

- Alice has the white present
- Eve has the green present is not correct, Eve has the green present after Alice and Eve swap, but before this swap Dave had a green present so after the swap Dave has a purple present and Alice has a green present, Eve has a green present is correct but the question asks what Fred has so we need to find what Fred has after the swaps.

To find what Fred has, let's go back and look at the swaps involving Fred.

- Fred had a yellow present initially
- Then Fred had a brown present after the second swap with Dave
- Then Fred had a pink ball after the third swap with Dave

After the final swap, Alice and Eve swapped, but that doesn't involve Fred, so we can ignore that one.

Fred has the pink ball after the third swap with Dave.

Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are playing a game. At the start of the game, they are each holding a ball: Alice has a orange ball, Bob has a pink ball, Claire has a brown ball, Dave has a green ball, Eve has a yellow ball, Fred has a red ball, and Gertrude has a blue ball.
As the game progresses, pairs of players trade balls. First, Bob and Gertrude swap balls. Then, Dave and Bob swap balls. Then, Eve and Gertrude swap balls. Then, Bob and Alice swap balls. Then, Eve and Fred swap balls. Then, Claire and Dave swap balls. Finally, Gertrude and Fred swap balls. At the end of the game, Alice has the

(A) orange ball
(B) pink ball
(C) brown ball
(D) green ball
(E) yellow ball
(F) red ball
(G) blue ball","{""ANSWER"": ""E""}",," let's break it down step by step:

1. Bob and Gertrude swap balls. So, Bob now has the blue ball, and Gertrude has the pink ball.
2. Dave and Bob swap balls. So, Dave now has the pink ball (which is actually Gertrude's pink ball after the first swap), and Bob has the green ball.
3. Eve and Gertrude swap balls. So, Eve now has the blue ball, and Gertrude has the yellow ball.
4. Bob and Alice swap balls. So, Bob now has the orange ball (which is Alice's original ball), and Alice has the green ball.
5. Eve and Fred swap balls. So, Eve now has the red ball, and Fred has the yellow ball.
6. Claire and Dave swap balls. So, Claire now has the green ball (which is Dave's original ball), and Dave has the brown ball.
7. Gertrude and Fred swap balls. So, Gertrude now has the red ball (which is Fred's original ball), and Fred has the blue ball.

Now, let's look at Alice's final ball. After the 4th swap, Alice has the green ball. There's no further swap involving Alice that would change her ball. So, Alice has the green ball at the end of the game.

Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Jamie, Bob is dancing with Ophelia, Claire is dancing with Lola, Dave is dancing with Patrick, Eve is dancing with Rodrigo, Fred is dancing with Melissa, and Gertrude is dancing with Karl.
Throughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Eve and Dave switch partners. Then, Fred and Eve switch partners. Then, Alice and Gertrude switch partners. Then, Dave and Bob switch partners. Then, Alice and Claire switch partners. Then, Alice and Gertrude switch partners. Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners. At the end of the dance, Fred is dancing with

(A) Jamie
(B) Ophelia
(C) Lola
(D) Patrick
(E) Rodrigo
(F) Melissa
(G) Karl","{""ANSWER"": ""F""}",," let's go through the steps one by one.

1. Eve and Dave switch partners. Eve is now dancing with Patrick, and Dave is dancing with Rodrigo.
2. Fred and Eve switch partners. Fred is now dancing with Rodrigo, and Eve is dancing with Melissa.
3. Alice and Gertrude switch partners. Alice is now dancing with Karl, and Gertrude is dancing with Jamie.
4. Dave and Bob switch partners. Dave is now dancing with Ophelia, and Bob is dancing with Rodrigo.
5. Alice and Claire switch partners. Alice is now dancing with Lola, and Claire is dancing with Karl.
6. Alice and Gertrude switch partners. This step is the same as step 3, so Alice is now dancing with Jamie, and Gertrude is dancing with Karl again.
7. Bob and Claire switch partners. Bob is now dancing with Lola, and Claire is dancing with Ophelia.

Now, let's see where Fred is dancing at the end. In step 2, Fred was dancing with Rodrigo. But in step 4, Dave and Bob switch partners, so Rodrigo is now dancing with Ophelia, not Bob. Then in step 5, Alice and Claire switch partners, and in step 6, Alice and Gertrude switch partners again, but this doesn't affect Fred's partner. In step 7, Bob and Claire switch partners, but this doesn't affect Fred's partner either.

So, at the end of the dance, Fred is still dancing with Rodrigo.

Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are on the same team in a soccer match. At the start of the match, they are each assigned to a position: Alice is playing striker, Bob is playing goalkeeper, Claire is playing left winger, Dave is playing right midfielder, Eve is playing center midfielder, Fred is playing benchwarmer, and Gertrude is playing left midfielder.
As the game progresses, pairs of players occasionally swap positions. First, Eve and Fred trade positions. Then, Claire and Eve trade positions. Then, Fred and Dave trade positions. Then, Alice and Claire trade positions. Then, Gertrude and Dave trade positions. Then, Bob and Alice trade positions. Finally, Gertrude and Dave trade positions.

(B) goalkeeper

(D) right midfielder
(E) center midfielder
(F) benchwarmer
(G) left midfielder","{""ANSWER"": ""D""}",,"Let's analyze the sequence of position swaps:

1. Eve and Fred trade positions.
   - Eve moves to Fred's position (benchwarmer), and Fred moves to Eve's position (center midfielder).

2. Claire and Eve trade positions.
   - Claire moves to Eve's position (center midfielder), and Eve moves to Claire's position (left winger).

3. Fred and Dave trade positions.
   - Fred moves to Dave's position (right midfielder), and Dave moves to Fred's position (benchwarmer).

4. Alice and Claire trade positions.
   - Alice moves to Claire's position (left winger), and Claire moves to Alice's position (striker).

5. Gertrude and Dave trade positions.
   - This swap happens twice, but let's analyze it step by step:
   - First swap: Gertrude moves to Dave's position (benchwarmer), and Dave moves to Gertrude's position (left midfielder).
   - Second swap: Since we don't know the current positions of Gertrude and Dave after the first swap, let's continue with the sequence. Gertrude moves to Dave's position (benchwarmer), and Dave moves to Gertrude's position (left midfielder). However, after the first swap, Dave is on Gertrude's position (left midfielder), so the second swap would mean Dave moves to benchwarmer and Gertrude moves to left midfielder.

6. Bob and Alice trade positions.
   - Bob moves to Alice's position (striker), and Alice moves to Bob's position (goalkeeper).

Now, let's find Gertrude's position after all the swaps:

Initially, Gertrude was playing left midfielder. After the first swap with Dave, Gertrude moved to the benchwarmer position. Then, in the second swap with Dave, Gertrude moved to the left midfielder position again. After that, there are no more swaps involving Gertrude and Dave, so Gertrude's position remains left midfielder.

1. Fred and Claire trade positions: Claire is now right midfielder, and Fred is striker.

6. Fred and Dave trade positions: Fred is now goalkeeper, and Dave is cheerleader.
7. Eve and Claire trade positions: Eve is now left midfielder, and Claire is center midfielder.

Now, let's find Gertrude's final position. In the last trade, Claire and Eve swapped positions, but we don't need to consider that because it doesn't affect Gertrude's position. Gertrude was last traded with Dave, and she became striker.

So, Gertrude is playing striker at the end of the match.

(C) Jamie
(D) Izzi
(E) Sam
(F) Karl
(G) Helga","{""ANSWER"": ""D""}",,"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Alice and Claire switch partners. This means Alice's new partner is Claire's old partner, and Claire's new partner is Alice's old partner.
   - Alice's old partner was Lola, so Alice's new partner is Lola.
   - Claire's old partner was Jamie, so Claire's new partner is Jamie.

2. Bob and Fred switch partners. This means Bob's new partner is Fred's old partner, and Fred's new partner is Bob's old partner.
   - Bob's old partner was Rodrigo, so Bob's new partner is Rodrigo.
   - Fred's old partner was Karl, so Fred's new partner is Karl.

3. Claire and Dave switch partners. This means Claire's new partner is Dave's old partner, and Dave's new partner is Claire's old partner.
   - Claire's old partner was Jamie, so Claire's new partner is Dave's old partner, which is Izzi.
   - Dave's old partner was Izzi, so Dave's new partner is Claire's old partner, which is Jamie.

4. Alice and Fred switch partners. This means Alice's new partner is Fred's old partner, and Fred's new partner is Alice's old partner.
   - Alice's old partner was Lola, so Alice's new partner is Fred's old partner, which is Karl.
   - Fred's old partner was Karl, so Fred's new partner is Alice's old partner, which is Lola.

5. Claire and Alice switch partners. This means Claire's new partner is Alice's old partner, and Alice's new partner is Claire's old partner.
   - Claire's old partner was Izzi, so Claire's new partner is Alice's old partner, which is Karl.
   - Alice's old partner was Karl, so Alice's new partner is Claire's old partner, which is Izzi.

6. Bob and Eve switch partners. This means Bob's new partner is Eve's old partner, and Eve's new partner is Bob's old partner.
   - Bob's old partner was Rodrigo, so Bob's new partner is Eve's old partner, which is Sam.
   - Eve's old partner was Sam, so Eve's new partner is Bob's old partner, which is Rodrigo.

7. Eve and Gertrude switch partners. This means Eve's new partner is Gertrude's old partner, and Gertrude's new partner is Eve's old partner.
   - Eve's old partner was Rodrigo, so Eve's new partner is Gertrude's old partner, which is Helga.
   - Gertrude's old partner was Helga, so Gertrude's new partner is Eve's old partner, which is Rodrigo.

Now, let's look at Claire's final partner. After step 3, Claire was dancing with Jamie. After step 5, Claire switched partners with Alice, so Claire was dancing with Karl. After step 6, Bob and Eve switched partners, but that doesn't affect Claire. After step 7, Eve and Gertrude switched partners, but that doesn't affect Claire either.

So, Claire is dancing with Karl at the end of the dance.

6. Dave and Eve switch partners. So now, Dave is dancing with Melissa, and Eve is dancing with Lola.

7. Claire and Eve switch partners. So now, Claire is dancing with Lola, and Eve is dancing with Patrick.

But we're looking for who Claire is dancing with at the end, not who Eve is dancing with. Let's go back to the end of step 6, where Eve is dancing with Lola. At that point, we know Alice is dancing with Ophelia, and Eve is dancing with Lola. Since Claire and Eve switched partners in the last step, Claire must be dancing with the person Eve was dancing with, which is Lola.

So, Claire is dancing with Lola.

Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are on the same team in a soccer match. At the start of the match, they are each assigned to a position: Alice is playing center midfielder, Bob is playing right winger, Claire is playing right midfielder, Dave is playing benchwarmer, Eve is playing cheerleader, Fred is playing goalkeeper, and Gertrude is playing left winger.
As the game progresses, pairs of players occasionally swap positions. First, Fred and Bob trade positions. Then, Bob and Claire trade positions. Then, Alice and Eve trade positions. Then, Dave and Claire trade positions. Then, Fred and Alice trade positions. Then, Bob and Fred trade positions. Finally, Alice and Gertrude trade positions. At the end of the match, Fred is playing
Options:
(A) center midfielder
(B) right winger
(C) right midfielder
(D) benchwarmer
(E) cheerleader
(F) goalkeeper
(G) left winger","{""ANSWER"": ""F""}",," let's go through the trades step by step:

1. First, Fred and Bob trade positions.
   - Fred was playing goalkeeper, so he moves to right winger (Bob's position).
   - Bob was playing right winger, so he moves to goalkeeper.

2. Then, Bob and Claire trade positions.
   - Bob was playing goalkeeper, so he moves to right midfielder (Claire's position).
   - Claire was playing right midfielder, so she moves to goalkeeper.

3. Then, Alice and Eve trade positions.
   - Alice was playing center midfielder, so she moves to cheerleader (Eve's position).
   - Eve was playing cheerleader, so she moves to center midfielder.

4. Then, Dave and Claire trade positions.
   - Dave was playing benchwarmer, so he moves to right midfielder (Claire's position).
   - Claire was playing goalkeeper, so she moves to benchwarmer.

5. Then, Fred and Alice trade positions.
   - Fred was playing right winger, so he moves to center midfielder (Alice's position).
   - Alice was playing cheerleader, so she moves back to center midfielder, but actually, she moved to center midfielder in the previous trade.

6. Then, Bob and Fred trade positions.
   - Bob was playing right midfielder, so he moves to right winger (Fred's position).
   - Fred was playing center midfielder, so he moves to right midfielder.

7. Finally, Alice and Gertrude trade positions.
   - Alice was playing center midfielder, so she moves to left winger (Gertrude's position).
   - Gertrude was playing left winger, so she moves to center midfielder.

So, after all the trades, let's find out where Fred is playing:
- After the 5th trade, Fred was playing center midfielder.
- After the 7th trade, Gertrude was playing center midfielder, not Fred.

But actually, after the 7th trade, Alice moved to left winger, and before that, Alice was playing center midfielder, so we need to go back to the 6th trade to find Fred's position.
- After the 6th trade, Fred was playing right midfielder.

But before that, in the 5th trade, Fred was playing center midfielder, and before that, in the 4th trade, Claire was playing goalkeeper, not Fred.

But actually, in the 3rd trade, Eve was playing center midfielder, not Fred.

But actually, in the 2nd trade, Claire was playing goalkeeper, not Fred.

But actually, in the 1st trade, Bob was playing goalkeeper, not Fred.

But actually, in the 1st trade, Fred was playing goalkeeper, and before that, he was playing right winger.

So, after all the trades, let's find out where Fred is playing:
- After the 1st trade, Fred was playing right winger.

1. Eve and Fred swap books. Initially, Eve has Frankenstein and Fred has Moby Dick. After this swap, Eve has Moby Dick and Fred has Frankenstein.
2. Claire and Bob swap books. Initially, Claire has The Great Gatsby and Bob has The Fellowship of the Ring. After this swap, Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring and Bob has The Great Gatsby. This trade doesn't affect Eve's book.
3. Fred and Eve swap books. But we already know Eve has Moby Dick, and Fred has Frankenstein from the previous trade. This swap means Eve gets Frankenstein, and Fred gets Moby Dick. So, Eve has Frankenstein now.
4. Gertrude and Alice swap books. Initially, Gertrude has Ulysses and Alice has Lolita. After this swap, Gertrude has Lolita and Alice has Ulysses. This trade doesn't affect Eve's book.
5. Fred and Dave swap books. Initially, Fred has Moby Dick and Dave has Hound of the Baskervilles. After this swap, Fred has Hound of the Baskervilles and Dave has Moby Dick. This trade doesn't affect Eve's book.
6. Gertrude and Eve swap books. Initially, Gertrude has Lolita and Eve has Frankenstein. After this swap, Gertrude has Frankenstein, and Eve has Lolita.

So, at the end of the semester, Eve has Lolita.

Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Patrick, Bob is dancing with Lola, Claire is dancing with Izzi, Dave is dancing with Rodrigo, Eve is dancing with Helga, Fred is dancing with Sam, and Gertrude is dancing with Melissa.
Throughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Eve and Bob switch partners. Then, Eve and Dave switch partners. Then, Fred and Gertrude switch partners.

Initially, Dave is dancing with Rodrigo.

First, Eve and Bob switch partners. This doesn't affect Dave.

Then, Eve and Dave switch partners. Now, Eve is dancing with Rodrigo (her original partner) and Dave is dancing with Eve (her original partner).

Next, Fred and Gertrude switch partners. This doesn't affect Dave.

Then, Gertrude and Alice switch partners. Now, Gertrude is dancing with Alice (her new partner) and Alice is dancing with Gertrude (her original partner).

Next, Alice and Dave switch partners. Now, Alice is dancing with Dave (her new partner) and Dave is dancing with Alice (his previous partner).

Finally, Claire and Alice switch partners. Now, Claire is dancing with Alice (her new partner) and Alice is dancing with Claire (her new partner).

Then, Alice and Dave switch partners again. Now, Alice is dancing with Dave's original partner, which is Rodrigo, and Dave is dancing with Alice's original partner, which is... Let's look at the sequence again. Initially, Dave was with Rodrigo. After Eve and Dave switched, Dave was with Eve, then Alice and Dave switched, so Dave was with Alice, then Alice and Dave switched again. So Dave is with Alice's original partner.

Initially, Alice was with Patrick, then she switched with Gertrude, then with Claire. So Alice's original partner is not Claire, but Claire's original partner. Claire was with Izzi, so Alice's original partner is Izzi.

So, at the end, Dave is dancing with Izzi.

- Alice had the red present initially, but it was swapped away in step 2.
- Alice had the brown present in step 2, but it was swapped away in step 3.
- Alice had the yellow present in step 3, but it was swapped away in step 4.
- Alice had the white present in step 4, but it was swapped away in step 6.
- Alice had the blue present in step 6, but it's not the correct answer. We need to check step 7.
- In step 7, Fred and Eve swapped gifts. Alice still has the blue present from step 6, but we need to find out who Fred had in step 6.

   - Eve has Claire's pink ball (initially Eve had green, now she has pink)
   - Claire has Eve's green ball (initially Claire had pink, now she has green)

2. Bob and Gertrude swap balls:
   - Bob has Gertrude's red ball (initially Bob had black, now he has red)

4. Fred and Claire swap balls:
   - Fred has Claire's green ball (initially Fred had brown, now he has green)
   - Claire has Fred's brown ball (initially Claire had green, now she has brown)

5. Gertrude and Claire swap balls:
   - Gertrude has Claire's brown ball (initially Gertrude had black, now she has brown)
   - Claire has Gertrude's black ball (initially Claire had brown, now she has black)

   - Alice has Eve's pink ball (initially Alice had purple, now she has pink)

Now, let's look at Dave's ball. After step 3, Dave had Alice's purple ball. After step 6, Dave and Alice swapped balls, so Dave got Alice's white ball. After step 7, there's no more swap involving Dave, so he still has the white ball.

- So, Dave (with Ophelia) was with Helga before the last switch, and Eve was with Helga before that, so Eve was with Helga before Dave was with Helga, meaning Eve was with Helga before Dave was with Helga.
- Before Dave was with Helga, Dave was with Karl, so Eve was with Helga before Dave was with Karl.
- Before Dave was with Karl, Dave was with Ophelia.

Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are playing a game. At the start of the game, they are each holding a ball: Alice has a green ball, Bob has a pink ball, Claire has a orange ball, Dave has a yellow ball, Eve has a blue ball, Fred has a black ball, and Gertrude has a purple ball.
As the game progresses, pairs of players trade balls. First, Gertrude and Alice swap balls. Then, Eve and Claire swap balls. Then, Claire and Gertrude swap balls. Then, Bob and Alice swap balls. Then, Eve and Alice swap balls. Then, Dave and Alice swap balls. Finally, Dave and Fred swap balls. At the end of the game, Gertrude has the

(D) yellow ball
(E) blue ball
(F) black ball
(G) purple ball","{
  ""ANSWER"": ""F""
}",," let's go through the trades step by step:

1. Gertrude and Alice swap balls. So Gertrude has Alice's green ball, and Alice has Gertrude's purple ball.

2. Eve and Claire swap balls. So Eve has Claire's orange ball, and Claire has Eve's blue ball.

3. Claire and Gertrude swap balls. So Claire has Gertrude's purple ball, and Gertrude has Claire's blue ball.

4. Bob and Alice swap balls. So Bob has Alice's purple ball, and Alice has Bob's pink ball.

5. Eve and Alice swap balls. So Eve has Alice's pink ball, and Alice has Eve's orange ball.

6. Dave and Alice swap balls. So Dave has Alice's orange ball, and Alice has Dave's yellow ball.

7. Dave and Fred swap balls. So Dave has Fred's black ball, and Fred has Dave's yellow ball.

Now, let's see who Gertrude has at the end of the game. Gertrude started with a purple ball, but then she traded it to Claire. Claire then traded it to Gertrude, but Gertrude had already traded it to Claire, so Claire must have had it before. But Claire traded it to Gertrude, so Gertrude must have it now. No, wait, that's not right. Claire had Gertrude's purple ball, but then Claire traded it to Gertrude, so Gertrude must have had it before Claire had it, which means Claire had it before Gertrude traded it to Claire. Which means Claire had Gertrude's purple ball before Gertrude had it, so Gertrude must have had Claire's blue ball. But Claire had Gertrude's purple ball before Claire had Eve's blue ball, so Gertrude must have had Eve's blue ball before Claire had Eve's blue ball. So Gertrude had Eve's blue ball before Eve had Claire's orange ball, so Gertrude must have had Eve's blue ball before Eve had Claire's orange ball, so Eve had Claire's orange ball before Eve had Alice's pink ball, so Claire had Eve's blue ball before Claire had Eve's blue ball. So Claire had Eve's blue ball before Claire had Eve's blue ball, so Eve had Claire's orange ball before Eve had Alice's pink ball, so Claire had Eve's blue ball before Claire had Eve's blue ball.

1. Gertrude and Alice swap gifts. Initially, Gertrude has a yellow present and Alice has a blue present. After the swap, Alice has the yellow present, and Gertrude has the blue present.

2. Dave and Eve swap gifts. Initially, Dave has a black ball, and Eve has a brown present. After the swap, Dave has the brown present, and Eve has the black ball.

3. Alice and Dave swap gifts. After the swap in step 1, Alice has the yellow present, and Dave has the blue present. Now, Alice gets the brown present (which Dave had after the swap in step 2), and Dave gets the yellow present.

4. Fred and Dave swap gifts. After the swap in step 3, Dave has the yellow present, and Fred has an orange ball. After the swap, Dave gets the orange ball, and Fred gets the yellow present.

5. Bob and Dave swap gifts. After the swap in step 4, Dave has the orange ball, and Bob has a white present. After the swap, Dave gets the white present, and Bob gets the orange ball.

6. Claire and Gertrude swap gifts. After the swap in step 1, Gertrude has the blue present, and Claire has a purple present. After the swap, Gertrude gets the purple present, and Claire gets the blue present.

7. Gertrude and Dave swap gifts. After the swap in step 6, Gertrude has the purple present, and Dave has the white present. After the swap, Gertrude gets the white present, and Dave gets the purple present.

Now, let's determine what Alice has at the end of the event. After the swap in step 3, Alice had the yellow present. However, in step 7, Gertrude and Dave swap gifts, and Gertrude gets the white present. Since Gertrude had the yellow present initially, the yellow present must have been passed on to someone else during the swaps. After the swap in step 6, Claire gets the blue present, which means Claire must have had the yellow present at some point. However, Claire had the purple present initially, so Claire must have gotten the yellow present from someone else. After the swap in step 3, Alice got the brown present, which means Alice must have had the yellow present before that. But we know Alice had the yellow present after the swap in step 1. Therefore, Alice must have gotten the yellow present from Gertrude in the first swap, and Gertrude must have gotten the yellow present from someone else.

After the swap in step 1, Gertrude has the blue present. In step 7, Gertrude gets the white present, but we know Gertrude had the blue present initially. Therefore, Gertrude must have gotten the white present from someone else. After the swap in step 5, Bob gets the orange ball, which means Bob must have had the white present before that. But we know Bob had the white present after the swap in step 5, so Bob must have gotten the white present from Dave in that swap. After the swap in step 4, Dave has the yellow present, which means Dave must have had the white present before that. But we know Dave had the yellow present after the swap in step 4, so Dave must have gotten the white present from Fred in that swap. After the swap in step 3, Dave has the blue present, which means Dave must have had the white present before that. But we know Dave had the blue present after the swap in step 3, so Dave must have gotten the white present from Alice in that swap. After the swap in step 2, Dave has the brown present, which means Dave must have had the white present before that. But we know Dave had the brown present after the swap in step 2, so Dave must have gotten the white present from Eve in that swap. After the swap in step 1, Eve has the black ball, which means Eve must have had the white present before that. But we know Eve had the black ball after the swap in step 1, so Eve must have gotten the white present from someone else.

However, we know that Alice had the yellow present after the swap in step 1. Therefore, Alice must have gotten the yellow present from Gertrude in that swap. But we also know that Gertrude had the blue present initially, which means Gertrude must have gotten the blue present from Alice in the first swap. Therefore, Alice must have had the blue present initially.

5. Fred and Bob trade positions:
   This is the same trade as step 3, so Fred is back to being the center midfielder and Bob is back to being the right winger.

6. Bob and Eve trade positions:
   Bob was the right winger, so now he's the goalkeeper. Eve was the left winger, so now she's the right winger.

7. Claire and Alice trade positions:
   Claire was the goalkeeper, so now she's the cheerleader. Alice was the cheerleader, so now she's the goalkeeper.

Now, let's look at the options for Bob's position at the end of the match:
   Bob was the right winger, then the center midfielder, then the right winger again, then the goalkeeper, and finally the right winger again. So, Bob is playing the right winger at the end of the match.

1. Eve and Dave swap balls: Eve has the blue ball, Dave has the red ball.
2. Gertrude and Eve swap balls: Gertrude has the blue ball, Eve has the yellow ball.
3. Bob and Fred swap balls: Bob has the black ball, Fred has the brown ball.
4. Claire and Fred swap balls: Claire has the black ball, Fred has the orange ball.
5. Alice and Claire swap balls: Alice has the black ball, Claire has the green ball.
6. Eve and Fred swap balls: Eve has the orange ball, Fred has the yellow ball.
7. Eve and Dave swap balls: Eve has the red ball, Dave has the blue ball (which is the last swap).

Now, let's look at the options and see which one matches the sequence for Bob. Bob had the brown ball initially. After the first swap (Bob and Fred), he got the black ball. Then, after the next swap (Claire and Fred), Fred got the orange ball, so Bob still has the black ball. The next swap (Alice and Claire) doesn't affect Bob. The next swap (Eve and Fred) doesn't affect Bob either. The final swap (Eve and Dave) doesn't affect Bob.

So, Bob has the black ball at the end.

At the start of the semester, they each buy one new book: Alice gets The Fellowship of the Ring, Bob gets Ulysses, Claire gets Hound of the Baskervilles, Dave gets Catch-22, Eve gets The Great Gatsby, Fred gets Frankenstein, and Gertrude gets Lolita.
As the semester proceeds, they start trading around the new books. First, Eve and Bob swap books. Then, Dave and Gertrude swap books. Then, Bob and Dave swap books. Then, Bob and Claire swap books. Then, Fred and Claire swap books. Then, Alice and Claire swap books. Finally, Claire and Dave swap books. At the end of the semester, Alice has

1. Eve and Bob swap books. So, Eve now has Ulysses, and Bob has The Great Gatsby.
2. Dave and Gertrude swap books. So, Dave now has Lolita, and Gertrude has Catch-22.
3. Bob and Dave swap books. So, Bob now has Lolita, and Dave has Ulysses.
4. Bob and Claire swap books. So, Bob now has Hound of the Baskervilles, and Claire has Lolita.
5. Fred and Claire swap books. So, Claire now has Frankenstein, and Fred has Lolita.
6. Alice and Claire swap books. So, Alice now has Hound of the Baskervilles, and Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring.
7. Claire and Dave swap books. So, Claire now has Catch-22, and Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring.

Now, let's see what Alice has at the end. In step 6, Alice got Hound of the Baskervilles from Claire, and in step 7, Claire got Catch-22 from Dave, but that doesn't affect Alice. So, Alice still has Hound of the Baskervilles.

(A) Sam
(B) Izzi
(C) Melissa
(D) Lola
(E) Helga
(F) Ophelia
(G) Karl","{""ANSWER"": ""F""}",,"Let's break down the sequence of partner switches.

1. Bob and Alice switch partners:
   - Bob is now dancing with Alice (who was originally with Sam),
   - Alice is now dancing with Bob (who was originally with Izzi).

2. Eve and Alice switch partners:
   - Eve is now dancing with Alice (who was just with Bob),
   - Alice is now dancing with Eve (who was originally with Helga).

3. Dave and Fred switch partners:
   - Dave is now dancing with Fred (who was originally with Ophelia),
   - Fred is now dancing with Dave (who was originally with Lola).

4. Gertrude and Eve switch partners:
   - Gertrude is now dancing with Eve (who was just with Alice),
   - Eve is now dancing with Gertrude (who was originally with Karl).

5. Eve and Dave switch partners:
   - Eve is now dancing with Dave (who was just with Fred),
   - Dave is now dancing with Eve (who was just with Gertrude).

6. Gertrude and Dave switch partners:
   - Gertrude is now dancing with Dave (who was just with Eve),
   - Dave is now dancing with Gertrude (who was just with Karl).

7. Bob and Claire switch partners:
   - Bob is now dancing with Claire (who was originally with Melissa),
   - Claire is now dancing with Bob (who was just with Alice).

Now, let's analyze the final state of Fred's partner. Initially, Fred was dancing with Ophelia. After the switch with Dave in step 3, Fred is now dancing with Dave. After the switch with Eve in step 5, Dave is now dancing with Eve. After the switch with Gertrude in step 6, Dave is now dancing with Gertrude. After the final switch with Bob in step 7, Dave is now dancing with Claire. However, the question is about Fred's partner, not Dave's.

Looking at the switches again, after step 3, Fred is dancing with Dave. Then, Dave switches partners with Eve (step 5), and later Eve switches partners with Gertrude (step 4), and then with Dave (step 5). After step 6, Dave is dancing with Gertrude. Now, we need to look at the initial information and the final switch. Initially, Gertrude was dancing with Karl. After the final switch in step 7, Gertrude is now dancing with Bob, not Dave. This means Dave is dancing with Gertrude's original partner, which is Karl.

However, looking at the options and the information given, we need to see what happens to Fred's partner after the switches. Fred was initially dancing with Ophelia. After the switch with Dave in step 3, Fred is now dancing with Dave. After the switch with Eve in step 5, Dave is now dancing with Eve. After the switch with Gertrude in step 6, Dave is now dancing with Gertrude. The key here is to realize that after the switch with Eve in step 5, Eve is now dancing with Dave. Then, Eve switches partners with Gertrude in step 4, which means Eve is now dancing with Gertrude. However, this is after the switch with Dave in step 5. The correct sequence to consider is Eve and Dave switching partners in step 5, and then Eve and Gertrude switching partners in step 4. This means Eve is now dancing with Gertrude, and Gertrude is now dancing with Eve's original partner, which is Helga.

However, looking at the sequence again, after the switch with Eve in step 5, Dave is now dancing with Eve. Then, Eve switches partners with Gertrude in step 4, which means Eve is now dancing with Gertrude. However, after step 5, Eve is dancing with Dave, not Gertrude. This means the correct sequence is Eve and Dave switching partners in step 5, and then Eve and Gertrude switching partners in step 4. This means Eve is now dancing with Gertrude, and Gertrude is now dancing with Eve's original partner, which is Helga. But after the switch in step 5, Eve is dancing with Dave, not Gertrude.

So after the switch with Eve in step 5, Dave is now dancing with Eve. Then, Eve switches partners with Gertrude in step 4, which means Eve is now dancing with Gertrude. However, after step 5, Eve is dancing with Dave, not Gertrude.

To determine Fred's partner, we need to see what happens to Dave's partner after the switches. Dave was initially dancing with Lola. After the switch with Fred in step 3, Dave is now dancing with Fred. After the switch with Eve in step 5, Dave is now dancing with Eve. After the",,2025-05-11 15:57:13

After the partner switches, Alice has danced with Helga, Melissa, Lola, Ophelia, Izzi, and finally we need to look at the last switch where Eve and Claire switched partners, but that doesn't affect Alice's partner. However, we can see that Alice has danced with all the partners except one.

From the initial situation, Alice was dancing with Melissa. After the partner switches, Alice has danced with Helga, Melissa, Lola, Ophelia, Izzi, and none of the other options match the sequence.

Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are on the same team in a soccer match. At the start of the match, they are each assigned to a position: Alice is playing left midfielder, Bob is playing cheerleader, Claire is playing right winger, Dave is playing striker, Eve is playing center midfielder, Fred is playing fullback, and Gertrude is playing benchwarmer.
As the game progresses, pairs of players occasionally swap positions. First, Gertrude and Alice trade positions. Then, Dave and Gertrude trade positions. Then, Alice and Gertrude trade positions.

1. Gertrude and Alice trade positions:
   - Gertrude goes from benchwarmer to left midfielder (Alice's original position)
   - Alice goes from left midfielder to benchwarmer (Gertrude's original position)

2. Dave and Gertrude trade positions:
   - Dave goes from striker to benchwarmer (Gertrude's position after the first swap)
   - Gertrude goes from benchwarmer to striker (Dave's original position)

3. Alice and Gertrude trade positions:
   - Alice goes from benchwarmer to striker (Gertrude's position after the second swap)
   - Gertrude goes from striker to benchwarmer (Alice's position after the second swap)

4. Eve and Claire trade positions:
   - Eve goes from center midfielder to right winger (Claire's original position)
   - Claire goes from right winger to center midfielder (Eve's original position)

5. Eve and Bob trade positions:
   - Eve goes from right winger to cheerleader (Bob's original position)
   - Bob goes from cheerleader to right winger (Eve's position after the fourth swap)

6. Claire and Gertrude trade positions:
   - Claire goes from center midfielder to benchwarmer (Gertrude's position after the third swap)
   - Gertrude goes from benchwarmer to center midfielder (Claire's position after the fifth swap)

7. Fred and Alice trade positions:
   - Fred goes from fullback to striker (Alice's position after the third swap)
   - Alice goes from striker to fullback (Fred's original position)

So, after all the swaps, we can determine Eve's final position. Eve was originally playing center midfielder. After the swaps, Eve's positions were:
- Center midfielder -> Right winger -> Cheerleader

But we see Eve swapped with Claire (center midfielder) in the 6th swap, and with Bob (cheerleader) in the 5th swap. So Eve's position after swapping with Bob is cheerleader.

(C) white present
(D) brown present
(E) green present
(F) blue present
(G) yellow present","{""ANSWER"": ""E""}",,"Let's follow the sequence of gift swaps to see who ends up with what.

Initially:
- Alice has a red present
- Bob has a purple present
- Claire has a white present
- Dave has a brown present
- Eve has a green present
- Fred has a blue present
- Gertrude has a yellow present

1. Dave and Bob swap gifts:
- Dave now has the purple present
- Bob now has the brown present

2. Alice and Bob swap gifts:
- Alice now has the brown present (from Bob)
- Bob now has the red present (from Alice)

3. Gertrude and Alice swap gifts:
- Gertrude now has the red present (from Alice)
- Alice now has the yellow present (from Gertrude)

4. Claire and Alice swap gifts:
- Claire now has the yellow present (from Alice)
- Alice now has the white present (from Claire)

5. Bob and Dave swap gifts:
- Bob now has the purple present (from Dave)
- Dave now has the brown present (from Bob)

6. Fred and Alice swap gifts:
- Fred now has the white present (from Alice)
- Alice now has the blue present (from Fred)

7. Fred and Eve swap gifts:
- Fred now has the green present (from Eve)
- Eve now has the blue present (from Fred)

Now, let's find out who has the blue present at the end. The only two people who could potentially have the blue present are Bob and Eve, but we know Eve has the blue present from the last swap. However, we can see from the swaps that Bob has the red present from swap 2. Then Alice got the blue present in swap 6, and then Alice got the white present in swap 4, then Alice got the yellow present in swap 3, then Alice got the brown present in swap 2.

Since the last swap involving Alice was the 6th swap, and Alice got the blue present from Fred in the 6th swap, then Alice had the blue present before that swap, and since Alice had the blue present before swap 6, then the person who had the blue present before Alice had it was Fred.

However, that was before the last swap, which involved Fred and Eve. Therefore, after the last swap, Eve has the blue present, and Fred has the green present.

The answer is (E).",,2025-05-11 15:57:13
