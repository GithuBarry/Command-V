```",,"Let's break down the expression step by step to solve it.

The given expression is:

\[ ((-1 + 2 + 9 * 5) - (-2 + -4 + -4 * -7)) \]

First, let's evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \((-1 + 2 + 9 * 5)\).

1. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication comes before addition.
2. So, we calculate \(9 * 5 = 45\).
3. Now, the expression becomes \(-1 + 2 + 45\).
4. Adding these together: \(-1 + 2 = 1\), and then \(1 + 45 = 46\).

So, the first part evaluates to 46.

Now, let's evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \((-2 + -4 + -4 * -7)\).

1. Again, following the order of operations, we do the multiplication first: \(-4 * -7 = 28\).
2. Now, the expression becomes \(-2 + -4 + 28\).
3. Adding these together: \(-2 + -4 = -6\), and then \(-6 + 28 = 22\).

So, the second part evaluates to 22.

Now we have:

\[ 46 - 22 \]

Subtracting these:

\[ 46 - 22 = 24 \]

Therefore, the answer is 24.

The given expression is:
\[ ((-9 * -5 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - -6 * -3 * 1)) \]

First, let's handle the inner parts of the expression one at a time.

For the left part: 
\[ -9 * -5 = 45 \]
So the expression becomes:
\[ (45 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - -6 * -3 * 1) \]

Next, we calculate \( 45 - 6 + -2 \):
\[ 45 - 6 = 39 \]
\[ 39 + -2 = 37 \]

So now our expression looks like this:
\[ 37 - (-8 - -6 * -3 * 1) \]

Now, for the right part:
\[ -6 * -3 = 18 \]
Since there's no multiplication or division between 18 and 1, it stays as 18.
So the expression inside the parentheses on the right becomes:
\[ -8 - 18 = -26 \]

Now the whole expression simplifies to:
\[ 37 - (-26) \]

The expression is:

((3 * -3 * 6 + -5) - (-2 + -7 - 7 - -7))

First, let's solve the inner parts of the expression.

1. Calculate 3 * -3 * 6:
   3 * -3 = -9 (because positive times negative is negative)
   -9 * 6 = -54 (because negative times positive is negative)

So, 3 * -3 * 6 = -54

2. Add -5 to that result:
   -54 + -5 = -59 (adding two negative numbers makes it more negative)

So, 3 * -3 * 6 + -5 = -59

Now, let's move to the right side of the subtraction part:

3. Calculate -2 + -7 - 7 - -7:
   -2 + -7 = -9 (negative plus negative is more negative)
   -9 - 7 = -16 (negative minus positive is more negative)
   -16 - -7 = -16 + 7 = -9 (negative minus negative is positive, so it becomes addition)

So, -2 + -7 - 7 - -7 = -9

The expression is ((6 * -6 * 8 * 1) * (-1 * 7 * -6 + -2))

First, let's evaluate the inner part of the expression:

Multiplying -1 and 7 gives -7.
-7 * -6 equals 42 (because negative times negative is positive).
Then we add -2 to 42, which gives us 40.

So now the expression simplifies to:
(6 * -6 * 8 * 1) * 40

Now, let's calculate the first part:
6 * -6 = -36
-36 * 8 = -288
-288 * 1 = -288

First, let's simplify inside each parenthesis separately.

For the first part: (-6 - -4 + 9 + 0)
-6 - -4 can be simplified to -6 + 4 because subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive.
So, -6 + 4 = -2.
Then, -2 + 9 = 7.
And finally, 7 + 0 = 7.

So, the first part simplifies to 7.

Now, for the second part: (1 + -4 - -9 * 6)
First, we need to handle the multiplication: -9 * 6 = -54.
Then, we substitute that back in: 1 + -4 - -54.
Which is 1 - 4 + 54.
1 - 4 = -3.
And then -3 + 54 = 51.

First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

Starting with the first part: (-6 - 4 * 2 - 6)

1. Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses:
   -4 * 2 = -8
   So now we have: (-6 - 8 - 6)

2. Perform the subtraction from left to right:
   -6 - 8 = -14

1 - 0 + 1 - 4

1 minus 0 is 1.
1 plus 1 is 2.
2 minus 4 is -2.

First, calculate -3 * 1:
-3 * 1 is -3.

Next, calculate -6 * -8:
Negative times negative gives a positive, so -6 * -8 equals 48.

Now we have:
-(-3 - 48)

Subtracting 48 from -3:
-3 - 48 = -51.

So, -(-51) means the negative of -51, which is 51.

According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so I'll do that first:

7 * -9 = -63.

Now, substitute that back into the expression:

1 + (-63) + (-5).

Next, perform the additions and subtractions from left to right:

1 - 63 = -62.

Again, follow the order of operations:

-5 * 2 = -10.

Substitute that back in:

3 + (-10) - 6.

2. Calculate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:
   \[ 5 + 3 - 9 * -8 \]

   According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we need to do the multiplication first:
   \[
   9 * -8 = -72
   \]
   Then substitute back into the expression:
   \[
   5 + 3 - (-72)
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   5 + 3 + 72 = 70
   \]
   So, the second part simplifies to \(70\).

Now, putting it all together:

3. Substitute the simplified parts back into the original expression:

The expression is ((7 - 4 + -3 * 4) - (5 + -8 - 6 + -5)).

First, I need to evaluate the operations inside each parenthesis separately, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

For the first part: (7 - 4 + -3 * 4)
- First, do the multiplication: -3 * 4 = -12.
- Now the expression becomes: 7 - 4 - 12.
- Then do the subtraction and addition from left to right: 7 - 4 = 3, then 3 - 12 = -9.
So, the first part evaluates to -9.

For the second part: (5 + -8 - 6 + -5)
- Since there's no multiplication or division, we just add and subtract from left to right.
- Start with 5 - 8 = -3.
- Then -3 - 6 = -9.
- Finally, -9 - 5 = -14.
So, the second part evaluates to -14.

Now, we have (-9) - (-14).

1. For (1 - 7 - -8 * 3):

- -8 * 3 = -24 (since a negative times a positive is a negative)

The expression is: ((-8 + -6 * 9 - 7) + (8 + 2 * -9 * -7))

First, let's handle the inner expressions in parentheses.

1. For (-8 + -6 * 9 - 7):
   - First, do the multiplication: -6 * 9 = -54.
   - Then, substitute that back into the expression: -8 + -54 - 7.
   - Now, perform the additions/subtractions from left to right:
     - -8 + -54 = -62.
     - -62 - 7 = -69.
   So, (-8 + -6 * 9 - 7) = -69.

2. For (8 + 2 * -9 * -7):
   - First, do the multiplication inside: 2 * -9 = -18.
   - Then, multiply again: -18 * -7 = 126.
   - Substitute that back into the expression: 8 + 126.
   - Perform the addition: 8 + 126 = 134.
   So, (8 + 2 * -9 * -7) = 134.

The expression is: ((-3 * 0 * 4 - -7) + (-9 * -6 - -8 + 1))

First, let's simplify inside the parentheses.

1. Calculate -3 * 0 * 4:
   - Any number multiplied by 0 is 0, so -3 * 0 = 0.
   - Then 0 * 4 is still 0.
   So, -3 * 0 * 4 = 0.

2. Now, we have (0 - -7):
   - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so 0 - -7 = 0 + 7 = 7.
   
So, the first part of the expression simplifies to 7.

Next, let's move on to the second part:

3. Calculate -9 * -6:
   - A negative times a negative is a positive, so -9 * -6 = 54.

4. Now, we have 54 - -8 + 1:
   - Again, subtracting a negative is adding a positive, so 54 - -8 = 54 + 8 = 62.
   - Then add 1: 62 + 1 = 63.

So, the second part of the expression simplifies to 63.

   5 - 7 = -2
   -2 - 8 = -10
   -10 - 6 = -16

So, (5 - 7 - 8 - 6) = -16.

2. Now, calculate (-2 * -8 * -9 + 4):

The given expression is ((1 + 1 * 3 - 2) * (-8 - -2 - 9 + -9)).

First, I need to evaluate the inner expressions according to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

1. For the first part: (1 + 1 * 3 - 2)
   - According to PEMDAS, multiplication comes before addition and subtraction.
   - So, 1 * 3 = 3.
   - Then, 1 + 3 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.

2. For the second part: (-8 - -2 - 9 + -9)
   - Simplify the double negative: - -2 = +2.
   - So, the expression becomes -8 + 2 - 9 - 9.
   - Perform the additions/subtractions from left to right:
     - -8 + 2 = -6
     - -6 - 9 = -15
     - -15 - 9 = -24

Now, we can put these results back into the original expression:

(2) * (-24)

Finally, multiply 2 by -24:

2 * -24 = -48

The given expression is ((5 + 6 * 4 * 9) + (-9 - 0 * 3 - 1)).

First, I need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means I should do multiplication before addition and subtraction.

Starting with the inner parentheses:

1. Calculate inside the first set of parentheses: (5 + 6 * 4 * 9)
   - First, multiply 6 * 4 = 24.
   - Then, multiply 24 * 9 = 216.
   - Now add 5 + 216 = 221.
   So, the first part becomes 221.

2. Now, calculate inside the second set of parentheses: (-9 - 0 * 3 - 1)
   - First, multiply 0 * 3 = 0.
   - Then, subtract 9 - 0 = 9.
   - Finally, subtract 9 - 1 = 8.
   So, the second part becomes 8.

Now we can combine these results:
221 + 8 = 229.

-9 * -9 = 81

Now, substitute that back into the expression:
((-1 - 9 + 81) - (1 + (-3) - 5 - 5))

Next, simplify the expression inside the first parenthesis:
-1 - 9 + 81 = -10 + 81 = 71

So now the expression looks like this:
(71 - (1 + (-3) - 5 - 5))

Now, let's simplify the expression inside the second parenthesis:
1 + (-3) - 5 - 5 = 1 - 3 - 5 - 5 = -2 - 5 - 5 = -7 - 5 = -12

So now we have:
71 - (-12)

1. Calculate the first part: \(-1 + -6 - -4 + -6\)

   - Start with -1.
   - Add -6: -1 + -6 = -7.
   - Subtract -4 (which is the same as adding 4): -7 + 4 = -3.
   - Add -6: -3 + -6 = -9.

So, \(-1 + -6 - -4 + -6 = -9\).

2. Now, calculate the second part: \(-2 * -5 - -1 * 1\)

   - Multiply -2 and -5: -2 * -5 = 10.
   - Multiply -1 and 1: -1 * 1 = -1.
   - Subtract -1 from 10: 10 - -1 = 10 + 1 = 11.

Expression 1: (-2 - -7 + 5 * -3)

1. Calculate the multiplication first: 5 * -3 = -15.
2. Now the expression is: -2 - -7 + (-15).
3. Subtracting a negative is like adding, so - -7 is the same as +7.
4. So the expression becomes: -2 + 7 - 15.
5. Now, -2 + 7 = 5.
6. And 5 - 15 = -10.

So the result of the first parenthesis is -10.

Expression 2: (2 - 8 + 5 * -7)

1. Again, calculate the multiplication first: 5 * -7 = -35.
2. The expression now is: 2 - 8 + (-35).
3. Subtracting 8 from 2 gives: 2 - 8 = -6.
4. And -6 + (-35) = -6 - 35 = -41.

So the result of the second parenthesis is -41.

Now, we add the results of both parentheses:

The expression is:

((3 - -6 - 7 + 3) + (-7 + 6 * 9 + 8))

First, I need to solve the inner parentheses separately.

For the first part: (3 - -6 - 7 + 3)

-3 minus a negative 6 is the same as 3 plus 6, so that's 9.
-Then 9 minus 7 is 2.
-And then 2 plus 3 is 5.

So, the first part simplifies to 5.

Now, for the second part: (-7 + 6 * 9 + 8)

According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication comes before addition, so:
-6 times 9 is 54.
-Then -7 plus 54 is 47.
-And 47 plus 8 is 55.

So, the second part simplifies to 55.

1. For the first part: -9 * 8 = -72
   So now we have: (-1 - -72 - -9)

2. For the second part: 2 * -6 = -12
   So now we have: (-9 - -12 + -6)

Now let's simplify each part further:

1. In (-1 - -72 - -9):
   - -72 and -9 are both negative, so subtracting them from -1:
   -1 - -72 = -1 + 72 = 71
   - Then 71 - -9 = 71 + 9 = 80

2. In (-9 - -12 + -6):
   - -9 and -12 are both negative, so subtracting -12 from -9:
   -9 - -12 = -9 + 12 = 3
   - Then 3 + -6 = 3 - 6 = -3

The given expression is:

\[ ((-8 - (-6 * 7 * 0)) * (0 + (-5) * (-8) - 0)) \]

First, let's handle the inner expressions inside the parentheses.

1. For the first part of the first parenthesis: \(-8 - (-6 * 7 * 0)\)

   - Inside the parentheses, we have \(-6 * 7 * 0\). Any number multiplied by 0 is 0, so this simplifies to \(0\).
   - Therefore, \(-8 - 0 = -8\).

2. Now the expression looks like this: \((-8) * (0 + (-5) * (-8) - 0)\)

3. Let's handle the second part of the second parenthesis: \(0 + (-5) * (-8) - 0\)

   - First, calculate \((-5) * (-8)\). When you multiply two negative numbers, the result is positive, so this equals \(40\).
   - Then, \(0 + 40 - 0 = 40\).

So now the expression is simplified to:

\[ (-8) * 40 \]

Starting with the innermost parentheses:

1. For the first part: (5 - -2 * -9 + 8)
   - Inside the parentheses, there's a multiplication: -2 * -9.
   - Multiplying -2 and -9 gives 18 (negative times negative equals positive).
   - So now it's 5 - 18 + 8.
   - Then we do the subtraction and addition from left to right: 5 - 18 = -13, then -13 + 8 = -5.
   - So, the first part simplifies to -5.

2. For the second part: (3 - 4 * -3 - -6)
   - Again, there's a multiplication inside the parentheses: 4 * -3.
   - Multiplying 4 and -3 gives -12 (positive times negative equals negative).
   - So now it's 3 - (-12) - -6.
   - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding, so 3 - (-12) is 3 + 12, which equals 15.
   - Then 15 - -6, again subtracting a negative is the same as adding, so 15 + 6 = 21.
   - So, the second part simplifies to 21.

Now, let's evaluate the second part: (7 - -3 + 3 * 1)
- Again, following PEMDAS/BODMAS, we do the multiplication first.
- 3 * 1 = 3
- Next, we need to handle the subtraction and addition. In mathematics, subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding the positive version of that number. So, 7 - -3 is the same as 7 + 3.

Now, let's solve the right part of the expression: \((5 \times 2 \times 6 \times -2)\).

1. Multiply \(5 \times 2\):
   \(5 \times 2 = 10\)

2. Multiply that result by \(6\):
   \(10 \times 6 = 60\)

3. Finally, multiply by \(-2\):
   \(60 \times -2 = -120\)

So, the right part simplifies to \(-120\).

Now, we need to multiply the results of the two parts together:

\[ 333 \times -120 \]

To calculate this:
1. Multiply \(333\) by \(120\):
   \(333 \times 120 = 333 \times (100 + 20) = 33300 + 6660 = 39960\)

Since we're multiplying by \(-120\), the final result will be \(-39960\).

```",,"Let's break down the expression step by step.

The expression is:

\[ ((-9 + -3 + 6 - 8) - (-7 \times -2 \times -6 + -6)) \]

First, let's solve the inner parts of the expression.

For the first part: \(-9 + -3 + 6 - 8\)

-9 + (-3) = -12

-12 + 6 = -6

-6 - 8 = -14

So, the first part simplifies to -14.

Now, for the second part: \(-7 \times -2 \times -6 + -6\)

First, calculate the multiplication:

-7 \times -2 = 14 (because negative times negative equals positive)

Then, 14 \times -6 = -84 (negative times positive equals negative)

Now, add -6 to -84:

-84 + (-6) = -90

So, the second part simplifies to -90.

Now we can put it all together:

\[-14 - (-90)\]

Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive:

-14 + 90 = 76

{""ANSWER"": -280}
```",,"Let's break this down step by step to solve the expression: ((-7 + 5 * -6 * -6) * (7 * -5 + -6 - 7))

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

### Innermost Parentheses

1. **Calculate inside the first set of parentheses:**
   \[
   -7 + 5 * -6 * -6
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication inside the parentheses first:**
   \[
   5 * -6 = -30
   \]
   So,
   \[
   -7 + (-30 * -6)
   \]

3. **Continue with the next multiplication:**
   \[
   -30 * -6 = 180
   \]
   Now the expression inside the first set of parentheses becomes:
   \[
   -7 + 180
   \]

4. **Finally, perform the addition:**
   \[
   -7 + 180 = 173
   \]

So, the first part of the expression simplifies to 173.

### Second Set of Parentheses

1. **Calculate inside the second set of parentheses:**
   \[
   7 * -5 + -6 - 7
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication first:**
   \[
   7 * -5 = -35
   \]
   So, the expression becomes:
   \[
   -35 + -6 - 7
   \]

3. **Perform the additions and subtractions from left to right:**
   \[
   -35 + -6 = -41
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   -41 - 7 = -48
   \]

So, the second part of the expression simplifies to -48.

### Final Calculation

Now, we multiply the results of the two simplified expressions:

\[
173 * -48
\]

To calculate this product:

1. Multiply 173 by 48:
   \[
   173 * 48 = 173 * (50 - 2) = 173 * 50 - 173 * 2 = 8650 - 346 = 8304
   \]

2. Since one of the factors was negative, the result will be negative:
   \[
   173 * -48 = -8304
   \]

So, the final answer is -8304. 

The JSON format for the answer would be:

The expression is:

((-8 * 0 + 2 * 2) * (-9 - 1 * -9 * 3))

First, let's handle the operations inside the parentheses.

Starting with the left parenthesis:

(-8 * 0 + 2 * 2)

-8 * 0 = 0 (because anything multiplied by zero is zero)
So, the expression becomes:
(0 + 2 * 2)

Then, 2 * 2 = 4, so the left part of the expression simplifies to:
0 + 4 = 4

Now, let's look at the right parenthesis:

-9 - 1 * -9 * 3

According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we need to do multiplication before subtraction.

1 * -9 = -9
So the expression now is:
-9 - (-9 * 3)

Next, -9 * 3 = -27, so the expression becomes:
-9 - (-27)

Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart, so:
-9 + 27 = 18

Now we have simplified both parts of the original expression:

(4) * (18)

Finally, multiplying these together:
4 * 18 = 72

   - 14 - -3 = 14 + 3 = 17 (because subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive)

2. For (-5 + 6 - -6 - -9):
   - -5 + 6 = 1
   - 1 - -6 = 1 + 6 = 7 (again, subtracting a negative is the same as adding)

The expression is ((5 - 6 - 7 + 6) - (-1 - 1 * -7 + 9)).

First, I need to solve the inner parts of the parentheses separately.

For (5 - 6 - 7 + 6):
- Start with 5.
- Subtract 6: 5 - 6 = -1.
- Subtract 7: -1 - 7 = -8.
- Add 6: -8 + 6 = -2.

So, (5 - 6 - 7 + 6) equals -2.

Now for (-1 - 1 * -7 + 9):
- Multiply first according to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): 1 * -7 = -7.
- So now we have -1 - (-7) + 9.
- Subtracting a negative is the same as adding: -1 - (-7) = -1 + 7 = 6.
- Then add 9: 6 + 9 = 15.

So, (-1 - 1 * -7 + 9) equals 15.

Now we can put these results back into the original expression:
(-2) - (15).

Subtracting 15 from -2 gives us -2 - 15 = -17.

So, -9 + 7 = -2.
Then, -2 + 2 + 2 = 2.

So, the first part simplifies to 2.

Now, for the second part: (-7 + -9 - -1 - 0)
-7 + -9 is -16.
-16 - -1 is -16 + 1 (subtracting a negative is adding a positive), which equals -15.
And -15 - 0 is still -15.

So, the second part simplifies to -15.

\[ -1 * -1 * -6 \]

Multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive number, and then multiplying that by another negative number makes it negative:

\[ (-1 * -1) = 1 \]
\[ 1 * -6 = -6 \]

So, we have:

\[ -6 - 7 \]

Now, subtracting 7 from -6:

- So, -4 * 3 equals -12.
- Now, the expression becomes: (-3 + -12 - -8)
- Simplifying further: -3 + -12 = -15
- And then, -15 - -8 (which is the same as -15 + 8) equals -7.

So, the first part simplifies to -7.

Now, let's look at the second part: (8 - 1 - -4 - -1)

- Again, according to the order of operations, there's no multiplication or division here, so we can just perform the additions and subtractions from left to right.
- 8 - 1 equals 7.
- Then, 7 - -4 (which is the same as 7 + 4) equals 11.
- Finally, 11 - -1 (which is the same as 11 + 1) equals 12.

So, the second part simplifies to 12.

Now, we combine the results of both parts:

-7 + 12

Which equals 5.

Therefore, the answer is 5.

1. Calculate inside the first set of parentheses:
   -4 - 5 + 2 + 7

   -4 - 5 = -9
   -9 + 2 = -7
   -7 + 7 = 0

   So, the first part simplifies to 0.

2. Now, calculate inside the second set of parentheses:
   -9 * 6 * -1 - -3

   First, do the multiplication:
   -9 * 6 = -54
   -54 * -1 = 54 (because a negative times a negative equals a positive)

   Then subtract -3:
   54 - -3 = 54 + 3 = 57

15 + 6 = 21

So, the left part is 21.

Now, on the right side of the subtraction:

Remember that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the positive version of that number. So -(-7) is the same as +7 and -(-8) is the same as +8.

So the expression becomes:

7 + 7 = 14
14 - 9 = 5

First, let's simplify inside the parentheses one at a time.

For the first part: (-5 - -1 - 7 * 8)
- The subtraction of negative numbers turns into addition: -5 + 1 - (7 * 8)
- Then do the multiplication: -5 + 1 - 56
- Now, add and subtract from left to right: -5 + 1 = -4, then -4 - 56 = -60

So, the first part simplifies to -60.

Now, for the second part: (-1 - -4 * -7 * 2)
- Again, subtracting a negative turns into addition: -1 + 4 * -7 * 2
- Do the multiplication in order: 4 * -7 = -28, then -28 * 2 = -56
- So, -1 + (-56) = -1 - 56 = -57

The second part simplifies to -57.

Now we multiply the results of the two parts:
-60 * -57

   - The multiplication comes first according to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): -9 * 7 = -63.
   - Now we have 4 - 8 - (-63).
   - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive: 4 - 8 + 63.

2. For the second part (5 + -8 * 9 * -2):
   - Again, the multiplication comes first: -8 * 9 = -72.
   - Then -72 * -2 = 144 (because negative times negative equals positive).
   - So, we have 5 + 144 = 149.

Now, we subtract the results of the two parts:

The expression is:

((-4 * 4 + -1 * 5) - (-6 + 1 - -8 - 6))

First, let's simplify inside the parentheses:

(-4 * 4 = -16)
(-1 * 5 = -5)

So, the first part becomes:
-16 + -5 = -21

Now, for the second part of the expression:
-6 + 1 = -5
-5 - -8 = -5 + 8 = 3 (because subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive)
3 - 6 = -3

So now we have:
-21 - (-3)

Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, so:
-21 + 3 = -18

The expression is: ((7 - -9 + 0 - 0) + (-9 + 5 - -9 * -1))

First, let's simplify inside the parentheses:

1. For (7 - -9 + 0 - 0):
   - 7 minus negative 9 is 7 plus 9, which equals 16.
   - Adding 0 doesn't change anything.
   - Subtracting 0 also doesn't change anything.
   So, (7 - -9 + 0 - 0) simplifies to 16.

2. Now for (-9 + 5 - -9 * -1):
   - Multiplication first: -9 times -1 is 9.
   - So now we have -9 + 5 - 9.
   - -9 plus 5 is -4.
   - Then -4 minus 9 is -13.

First, I need to evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: (4 + 3 + -9 + -2).

4 + 3 = 7

Then, 7 + (-9) = 7 - 9 = -2

Finally, -2 + (-2) = -2 - 2 = -4

So, the first part of the expression evaluates to -4.

Now, let's move to the second set of parentheses: (7 * 2 + 8 - 1).

First, calculate the multiplication: 7 * 2 = 14

Then, add 8: 14 + 8 = 22

Finally, subtract 1: 22 - 1 = 21

The expression is ((3 - 1 + -3 * -4) - (8 * 9 - -7 - -6)).

First, I need to evaluate the operations inside the parentheses.

Starting with the first part: (3 - 1 + -3 * -4)

- According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication comes before addition and subtraction.
- So, -3 * -4 equals 12.
- Then we have 3 - 1 + 12.
- 3 - 1 is 2.
- 2 + 12 is 14.
So, the first part simplifies to 14.

Now for the second part: (8 * 9 - -7 - -6)

- Again, following PEMDAS/BODMAS, we start with multiplication.
- 8 * 9 equals 72.
- Then we have 72 - -7.
- Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart, so 72 - -7 is 72 + 7, which is 79.
- Now we have 79 - -6.
- Similarly, subtracting a negative number is like adding a positive one, so 79 - -6 becomes 79 + 6, which is 85.
So, the second part simplifies to 85.

Now we can put it all together: (14) - (85).

Subtracting 85 from 14 gives us 14 - 85 = -71.

1. \(-6 \times -7 = 42\)
2. \(42 \times -8 = -336\)

So, \((-6 \times -7 \times -8) = -336\).

2. Subtract \(-3\) (which is the same as adding 3):
   \[ 5 - -3 = 5 + 3 = 8 \]
   
3. Add \(-9\):
   \[ 8 + -9 = 8 - 9 = -1 \]

So, the first part simplifies to \(-1\).

Now, let's simplify inside the second set of parentheses:

The expression is:

((5 * -1 - 7 * 5) - (6 - -5 * 3 * 7))

First, let's handle the inner parentheses and perform the multiplications inside them.

For the first part: 5 * -1 - 7 * 5
- 5 * -1 is 5 because a negative times a negative is positive.
- 7 * 5 is 35.
So, 5 - 35 = -30.

For the second part: 6 - -5 * 3 * 7
- First, -5 * 3 is -15.
- Then, -15 * 7 is -105.
- So, 6 - (-105) is 6 + 105 which equals 111.

1. 9 - -5 is the same as 9 + 5, which equals 14.
2. Then, 14 - 1 is 13.
3. Finally, 13 + -2 is 13 - 2, which equals 11.

So, the first part simplifies to 11.

Now, let's simplify inside the second set of parentheses (-5 * 3 - -5 - 0):

1. -5 * 3 is -15.

   - Finally, \(7 + 4 = 11\)

2. For the second part of the expression inside the second parenthesis:
   \[ 2 * 7 - (-3) - (-1) \]
   - First, calculate the multiplication: \(2 * 7 = 14\)

We know that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart. So, it becomes:

Now, let's add and subtract these numbers:

\(-3 + 8 = 5\)

\(5 + 7 = 12\)

1. Calculate 0 * -4:
   0 * -4 = 0

2. Calculate -7 * 5:
   -7 * 5 = -35

3. Now, subtract -35 from 0:

First, I need to solve the expressions inside the parentheses.

The first part is (-9 + 6 + 1 - 7):

-2 - 7 = -9

So, the result of the first part is -9.

The second part is (2 - -2 + -9 + -2):

2 - -2 = 2 + 2 = 4
4 + -9 = 4 - 9 = -5
-5 + -2 = -5 - 2 = -7

   1 * 0 = 0

2. Subtract -5 from 0:
   0 - (-5) = 0 + 5 = 5

3. Subtract 3 from 5:

The given expression is:

First, let's evaluate the inner parts of the expression.

1. Evaluate the first part: (-9 + 5 * 0 - -8)
   - According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we need to do multiplication before addition/subtraction.
   - \(5 * 0 = 0\).
   - So, the expression becomes: (-9 + 0 - -8).
   - Simplifying further: -9 + 0 + 8 = -9 + 8 = -1.

2. Evaluate the second part: (6 - -5 * -7 + -8)
   - Again, following the order of operations, we do the multiplication first.
   - \(-5 * -7 = 35\) (negative times negative equals positive).
   - So, the expression becomes: (6 - 35 + -8).
   - Simplifying further: 6 - 35 - 8 = 6 - 43 = -37.

Now, we combine the results of both parts:

1. Calculate 5 * 2:
   5 * 2 = 10

2. Calculate 5 * 3:
   5 * 3 = 15

Now, substitute these values back into the expression:

((-2 - -7 - 10) + (-3 - 15 + -7))

Next, simplify the inner expressions by handling the subtraction and negation:

3. Simplify -2 - -7:
   -2 - -7 = -2 + 7 = 5

4. So now we have:
   (5 - 10) + (-3 - 15 + -7)

5. Simplify 5 - 10:
   5 - 10 = -5

6. Now the expression is:

-9 + -7 = -16

-8 - -7 is the same as -8 + 7, which equals -1.

-1 + 0 is just -1, and then adding 3 gives us 2.

-3 + 5 is 2, and then subtracting 40 from 2 gives us -38.

First, let's handle the inner operations inside the parentheses.

1. For (8 - -9 * 4 * 9):
   - According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we need to do multiplication before subtraction.
   - So, -9 * 4 * 9 = -36 * 9 = -324.
   - Now, 8 - -324 = 8 + 324 = 332.

2. Next, for (-4 * -3 * 7 * 9):
   - Multiplying negative numbers gives positive results when there's an even number of negatives.
   - -4 * -3 = 12 (positive).
   - 12 * 7 = 84 (positive).
   - 84 * 9 = 756 (positive).

So now our expression simplifies to:
(332) * (756)

3. Finally, multiplying these two results:
   332 * 756

To calculate this product:

- 332 * 756 can be broken down as follows:
  - 332 * 700 = 232400
  - 332 * 50 = 16600
  - 332 * 6 = 1992
- Adding them together: 232400 + 16600 + 1992 = 250992

Therefore, the answer is 250992.

The expression is: ((1 * -9 - 4 + -9) + (-1 + -6 + 9 - 5))

First, let's simplify inside the first set of parentheses:

1. Calculate 1 * -9:
   1 * -9 = -9

2. Now, substitute that back into the expression:
   (-9 - 4 + -9)

3. Combine like terms:
   -9 - 4 = -13
   -13 + -9 = -22

So, the first part simplifies to -22.

Now, let's look at the second part:

-1 + -6 + 9 - 5

4. Combine these numbers step by step:
   -1 - 6 = -7
   -7 + 9 = 2
   2 - 5 = -3

So, the second part simplifies to -3.

Now, we add the results of the two parts together:

-22 + (-3) = -22 - 3 = -25

Therefore, the final answer is -25.

```",,"Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to solve the expression inside the first set of parentheses: (-1 + 2 - 9 + 0).

-1 + 2 = 1
1 - 9 = -8
-8 + 0 = -8

So, the first part is -8.

Now, let's look at the second set of parentheses: (0 - -2 + -6 - 2).

Subtracting a negative is like adding, so 0 - -2 becomes 0 + 2, which is 2.
Then we have 2 + -6, which is 2 - 6 = -4.
Finally, -4 - 2 = -6.

So, the second part is -6.

Now, we multiply the results of the two parts: -8 * -6.

When you multiply two negative numbers, the result is positive. So:
-8 * -6 = 48.

Therefore, the answer is 48.

The expression is: ((7 * -5 * -9 + 7) - (2 + -8 * 6 * 3))

First, let's calculate inside the first set of parentheses:

1. Calculate 7 * -5 * -9:
   - 7 * -5 = -35 (negative times negative gives positive)
   - -35 * -9 = 315 (again, negative times negative gives positive)

So, 7 * -5 * -9 = 315

2. Now add 7 to the result:
   - 315 + 7 = 322

So, the first part inside the first set of parentheses equals 322.

Now, let's calculate inside the second set of parentheses:

1. Calculate -8 * 6 * 3:
   - -8 * 6 = -48 (negative times positive gives negative)
   - -48 * 3 = -144 (negative times positive gives negative)

So, -8 * 6 * 3 = -144

2. Add 2 to the result:
   - 2 + (-144) = 2 - 144 = -142

So, the second part inside the second set of parentheses equals -142.

Finally, we need to subtract the second part from the first part:

- 322 - (-142) = 322 + 142 = 464

The given expression is:

\[ (-5 + -8 - -6 * 7) + (9 * -7 - -5 - -4) \]

First, let's handle the operations inside the parentheses separately.

For the first part: \( -5 + -8 - -6 * 7 \)

1. Calculate the multiplication first: \(-6 * 7 = -42\)
2. Now we have: \( -5 + -8 - -42 \)
3. Simplify the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   - First, \( -5 + -8 = -13 \)
   - Then, \( -13 - -42 = -13 + 42 = 29 \)

So, the first part evaluates to 29.

Now, for the second part: \( 9 * -7 - -5 - -4 \)

1. Calculate the multiplication first: \( 9 * -7 = -63 \)
2. Now we have: \( -63 - -5 - -4 \)
3. Simplify the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   - First, \( -63 - -5 = -63 + 5 = -58 \)
   - Then, \( -58 - -4 = -58 + 4 = -54 \)

So, the second part evaluates to -54.

Now, combine the results of both parts:

\[ 29 + -54 = 29 - 54 = -25 \]

Therefore, the answer is -25.

For the left part of the expression:
1. Calculate \(-6 \times 9\):
   \[ -6 \times 9 = -54 \]

2. Subtract \(-5\) (which is the same as adding 5):
   \[ -54 - (-5) = -54 + 5 = -49 \]

3. Add 8:
   \[ -49 + 8 = -41 \]

So, the left part of the expression simplifies to \(-41\).

Now, for the right part of the expression:
1. Calculate \(-8 \times -6\):
   \[ -8 \times -6 = 48 \]

2. Subtract \(-1 \times 0\). Since any number multiplied by 0 is 0:
   \[ 48 - (-1 \times 0) = 48 - 0 = 48 \]

The given expression is:

((5 - -2 * 7 + -2) - (0 * 9 * -6 - -7))

First, let's simplify inside the parentheses.

1. In the first part of the expression, (5 - -2 * 7 + -2):

- According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we need to do multiplication first.
- -2 * 7 = -14

So now we have: (5 - -14 + -2)

- Next, subtracting a negative is the same as adding, so - -14 is the same as +14.
- Then, 5 + 14 = 19
- And finally, 19 + -2 = 19 - 2 = 17

So the first part simplifies to 17.

2. Now for the second part of the expression, (0 * 9 * -6 - -7):

- Again, start with the multiplication.
- 0 * 9 = 0
- Then 0 * -6 = 0
- So we have 0 - -7
- Subtracting a negative is the same as adding, so - -7 is +7.
- Therefore, 0 + 7 = 7

So the second part simplifies to 7.
