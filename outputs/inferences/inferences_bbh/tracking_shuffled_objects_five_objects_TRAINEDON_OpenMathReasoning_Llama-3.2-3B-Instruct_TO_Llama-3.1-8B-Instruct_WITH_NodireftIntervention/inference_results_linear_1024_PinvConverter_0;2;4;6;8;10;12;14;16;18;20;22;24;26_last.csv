(D) brown present
(E) green present
(F) blue present
(G) yellow present","{""ANSWER"": ""E""}",," LET ME HELP YOU WITH THAT.

Here's the step-by-step solution to the problem:

Initially, the presents are distributed as follows:
- Alice: red
- Bob: purple
- Claire: white
- Dave: brown
- Eve: green
- Fred: blue
- Gertrude: yellow

After the first swap: Dave and Bob swap their gifts.
- Alice: red
- Bob: brown
- Claire: white
- Dave: purple
- Eve: green
- Fred: blue
- Gertrude: yellow

After the second swap: Alice and Bob swap their gifts.
- Alice: brown
- Bob: red
- Claire: white
- Dave: purple
- Eve: green
- Fred: blue
- Gertrude: yellow

After the third swap: Gertrude and Alice swap their gifts.
- Alice: yellow
- Bob: red
- Claire: white
- Dave: purple
- Eve: green
- Fred: blue
- Gertrude: brown

After the fourth swap: Claire and Alice swap their gifts.
- Alice: white
- Bob: red
- Claire: yellow
- Dave: purple
- Eve: green
- Fred: blue
- Gertrude: brown

After the fifth swap: Bob and Dave swap their gifts.
- Alice: white
- Bob: purple
- Claire: yellow
- Dave: red
- Eve: green
- Fred: blue
- Gertrude: brown

After the sixth swap: Fred and Alice swap their gifts.
- Alice: blue
- Bob: purple

- Gertrude: brown

After the seventh swap: Fred and Eve swap their gifts.

Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are playing a game. At the start of the game, they are each holding a ball: Alice has a green ball, Bob has a white ball, Claire has a yellow ball, Dave has a pink ball, Eve has a orange ball, Fred has a black ball, and Gertrude has a brown ball.
As the game progresses, pairs of players trade balls. First, Bob and Gertrude swap balls. Then, Fred and Claire swap balls. Then, Dave and Gertrude swap balls. Then, Bob and Gertrude swap balls. Then, Alice and Claire swap balls. Then, Gertrude and Claire swap balls. Finally, Eve and Claire swap balls. At the end of the game, Fred has the

Initially:
Alice has a green ball
Bob has a white ball
Claire has a yellow ball
Dave has a pink ball
Eve has a orange ball
Fred has a black ball
Gertrude has a brown ball

Step 1: Bob and Gertrude swap balls
- Bob has a brown ball

- Claire has an orange ball

Now, we know that Claire has an orange ball. We can backtrack to find out what ball Fred has. Initially, Fred had a black ball. No one swapped a ball with Fred after he swapped with Claire. So, Fred still has the black ball.

Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are on the same team in a soccer match. At the start of the match, they are each assigned to a position: Alice is playing benchwarmer, Bob is playing goalkeeper, Claire is playing striker, Dave is playing right midfielder, Eve is playing center midfielder, Fred is playing cheerleader, and Gertrude is playing left midfielder.
As the game progresses, pairs of players occasionally swap positions. First, Dave and Claire trade positions. Then, Dave and Fred trade positions. Then, Claire and Fred trade positions.

1. Dave and Claire trade positions:
   - Dave (right midfielder) -> Claire (striker)
   - Claire (striker) -> Dave (right midfielder)

2. Dave and Fred trade positions:
   - Dave (right midfielder) -> Fred (cheerleader)
   - Fred (cheerleader) -> Dave (right midfielder)

3. Claire and Fred trade positions:
   - Claire (striker) -> Fred (cheerleader)
   - Fred (cheerleader) -> Claire (striker)

4. Eve and Gertrude trade positions:
   - Eve (center midfielder) -> Gertrude (left midfielder)
   - Gertrude (left midfielder) -> Eve (center midfielder)

5. Alice and Fred trade positions:
   - Alice (benchwarmer) -> Fred (cheerleader)
   - Fred (cheerleader) -> Alice (benchwarmer)

6. Dave and Fred trade positions (again):
   - Dave (right midfielder) -> Fred (cheerleader)
   - Fred (cheerleader) -> Dave (right midfielder)

7. Dave and Bob trade positions:
   - Dave (right midfielder) -> Bob (goalkeeper)
   - Bob (goalkeeper) -> Dave (right midfielder)

After all the swaps, let's determine Gertrude's position:

Initially, Gertrude was the left midfielder.

In the first swap, Gertrude and Eve traded positions, but then Eve and Gertrude traded positions again. This means Gertrude's position was swapped twice, so she ended up in her original position.

However, in the final swap, Dave and Bob traded positions. Since Dave was the right midfielder and Bob was the goalkeeper, we need to find out what happened to Dave's previous position (right midfielder) after all the other swaps.

Initially, Dave was the right midfielder. Then, he swapped positions with Claire, but Claire swapped positions with Fred, so Dave ended up with Fred's position (cheerleader).

Then, Dave swapped positions with Fred again, but this time, Dave ended up with Dave's previous position (right midfielder).

So, after all the swaps, Dave ended up as the right midfielder.

Since Dave and Bob swapped positions in the final swap, Bob became the right midfielder, and Dave became the goalkeeper.

Gertrude's position was swapped twice, so she ended up in her original position. Therefore, Gertrude is the left midfielder.

Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude are on the same team in a soccer match. At the start of the match, they are each assigned to a position: Alice is playing left midfielder, Bob is playing cheerleader, Claire is playing right winger, Dave is playing striker, Eve is playing center midfielder, Fred is playing fullback, and Gertrude is playing benchwarmer.
As the game progresses, pairs of players occasionally swap positions. First, Gertrude and Alice trade positions. Then, Dave and Gertrude trade positions. Then, Alice and Gertrude trade positions. Then, Eve and Claire trade positions. Then, Eve and Bob trade positions. Then, Claire and Gertrude trade positions. Finally, Fred and Alice trade positions. At the end of the match, Eve is playing
Options:
(A) left midfielder
(B) cheerleader
(C) right winger
(D) striker
(E) center midfielder
(F) fullback
(G) benchwarmer","{""ANSWER"": ""E""}",," LET ME HELP YOU WITH THE QUESTION.

Since the question is asking about the position of Eve at the end of the match, let's follow the sequence of position swaps:

1. Gertrude and Alice trade positions.
2. Dave and Gertrude trade positions.
3. Alice and Gertrude trade positions (so Alice is back to her original position).
4. Eve and Claire trade positions.
5. Eve and Bob trade positions.
6. Claire and Gertrude trade positions (so Claire is back to her original position).
7. Fred and Alice trade positions.

After the first swap, Eve's position is unchanged. After the second swap, Eve's position is also unchanged. After the third swap, Eve's position is again unchanged. After the fourth swap, Eve and Claire swap positions, so Eve is now playing right winger. After the fifth swap, Eve and Bob swap positions, so Eve is now playing cheerleader. After the sixth swap, Claire's position is unchanged, so Eve is still playing cheerleader. After the seventh swap, Fred and Alice swap positions, so Alice is now playing fullback, but this does not affect Eve's position.

Therefore, Eve is playing cheerleader at the end of the match.
