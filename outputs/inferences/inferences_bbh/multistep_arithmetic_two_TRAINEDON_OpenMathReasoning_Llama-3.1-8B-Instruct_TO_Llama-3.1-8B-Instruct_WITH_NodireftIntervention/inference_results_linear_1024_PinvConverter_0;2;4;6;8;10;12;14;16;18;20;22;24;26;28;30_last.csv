   -5 - 6 * 5
   First, multiply 6 and 5: 6 * 5 = 30
   Then, subtract 30 from -5: -5 - 30 = -35

2. Now, add -9 to the result: -35 + (-9) = -44

3. Next, evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses on the right side:
   1 + (-4) - (-2 * 6)
   First, multiply -2 and 6: -2 * 6 = -12
   Then, add 1 and -4: 1 + (-4) = -3
   Next, subtract -12 from -3: -3 - (-12) = -3 + 12 = 9

4. Finally, add the results of the left and right sides: -44 + 9 = -35

So, the answer is -35.

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

The expression is: (-8 * 4 + 7 - 5) + (9 + -6 + -2 * 5)

Let's start with the first part: -8 * 4 + 7 - 5

Multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so we do the multiplication first: -8 * 4 = -32

Now we have: -32 + 7 - 5

Next, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right: -32 + 7 = -25, then -25 - 5 = -30

Now we have: -30

Now we move on to the second part: 9 + -6 + -2 * 5

Again, we do the multiplication first: -2 * 5 = -10

Now we have: 9 + -6 + -10

Next, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 9 + -6 = 3, then 3 - 10 = -7

Now we have: -7

Now we add the two parts together: -30 + (-7)

When we add a negative number, it's the same as subtracting a positive number, so -30 + (-7) is the same as -30 - 7

Now we do the subtraction: -30 - 7 = -37

So the answer is -37.

((-2 - 2 * 2 + 0) - (7 - 6 - -7 - -1))","{""ANSWER"": -12}",,"Let's break down the expression step by step.

First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:
   -2 - 2 * 2 + 0
   and
   7 - 6 - (-7) - (-1)

2. Start with the first expression:
   -2 - 2 * 2 + 0
   Multiply 2 and 2: 2 * 2 = 4
   Now the expression is: -2 - 4 + 0
   Add -2 and -4: -2 - 4 = -6
   Now the expression is: -6 + 0
   Add -6 and 0: -6 + 0 = -6

3. Now, let's evaluate the second expression:
   7 - 6 - (-7) - (-1)
   Subtract 6 from 7: 7 - 6 = 1
   Now the expression is: 1 - (-7) - (-1)
   Subtract a negative number is the same as adding a positive number, so:
   1 + 7 + 1
   Add 1, 7, and 1: 1 + 7 + 1 = 9

4. Now that we have the results of the expressions inside the parentheses, we can rewrite the original expression:
   (-6) - 9

5. Subtract 9 from -6:
   -6 - 9 = -15

So the result of the expression is -15.

   9 - 6 - 1 = 2
   2 + (-4) = 2 - 4 = -2

2. Now the equation becomes:
   (-7 - (-8)) * (-2)

3. Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
   -7 - (-8) = -7 + 8 = 1

4. Now the equation becomes:

To simplify this, we need to remember that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number. So, -(-3) is the same as +3.

So, the expression becomes:
9 + 2 + 3 + 3
= 9 + 2 + 6

Now, let's simplify the expression inside the second parentheses:
-5 + 6 - (-6) - (-9)

Again, subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number. So, -(-6) is the same as +6 and -(-9) is the same as +9.

= 7 + 7 + 9 + 8 (since subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number)
= 7 + 7 + 9 + 8
= 31

Now, let's substitute these values back into the original expression:
(8 + 1 + 6 + 6) - (7 - -7 - 9 - -8)
= 21 - 31

To subtract 31 from 21, we need to borrow from the tens place:
21 - 30 = 1 (we borrowed 10 from the tens place, leaving 1 in the tens place)
1 - 1 = 0

So the result is 0.

First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:
   -8 - (-1) = -8 + 1 = -7
   -2 * -7 = 14

So, (-8 - (-1) - (-2 * -7)) becomes (-8 + 1 - 14) = -21

Next, evaluate the other expression inside the parentheses:
3 + 2 = 5
3 * 3 = 9

So, (3 + 2 - 3 * 3) becomes 5 - 9 = -4

Now, we add the two results:
-21 + (-4) = -25

So the answer is -25.

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). In this case, we have parentheses, so we start with those.

Inside the first parentheses: 4 + 5 - 7 + 9
To evaluate this, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
4 + 5 = 9
9 - 7 = 2
2 + 9 = 11

So the first parentheses equals 11.

Next, we need to evaluate the second parentheses: -1 - -4 + -7 - -5
To do this, we also do the operations from left to right:
-1 - -4 = -1 + 4 = 3
3 - -7 = 3 + 7 = 10
10 - -5 = 10 + 5 = 15

So the second parentheses equals 15.

Now we multiply the results of the two parentheses: 11 * 15
Multiplying these numbers, we get 165.

First, let's simplify the expressions inside the parentheses separately.

Inside the first parentheses: (-4 + 5 - 4 - -6)

To simplify this, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Add 5 and -4: 5 + (-4) = 1
2. Add 1 and -6: 1 + (-6) = -5

So, the first parentheses simplifies to -5.

Now, let's simplify the expression inside the second parentheses: (-3 * -1 * 2 - -4)

Following the order of operations:

1. Multiply -3 and -1: (-3) * (-1) = 3
2. Multiply 3 and 2: 3 * 2 = 6
3. Subtract -4 from 6: 6 - (-4) = 6 + 4 = 10

So, the second parentheses simplifies to 10.

Now that we have simplified both parentheses, we can rewrite the original expression as:

((8 - 4 - -8 - -7) + (6 - 5 - -1 - 4))","{""ANSWER"": 14}",," let's break it down step by step.

First, let's evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses separately.

For the first parentheses: (8 - 4 - -8 - -7)
1. Subtract 4 from 8: 8 - 4 = 4
2. Add 8 to 4: 4 + 8 = 12
3. Add 7 to 12: 12 + 7 = 19

So the first parentheses is equal to 19.

Now, let's evaluate the second parentheses: (6 - 5 - -1 - 4)
1. Subtract 5 from 6: 6 - 5 = 1
2. Add 1 to 1: 1 + 1 = 2
3. Subtract 4 from 2: 2 - 4 = -2

So the second parentheses is equal to -2.

Now, let's add the results of both parentheses: 19 + (-2)
1. Subtract 2 from 19: 19 - 2 = 17

So the final result is 17.

2. Next, we do the multiplication inside the second parentheses:
   -9 * 5 = -45
   -4 - (-45) = -4 + 45 = 41
   -1 is already outside the multiplication, so we add it: 41 - 1 = 40

First, let's evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses separately.

For the first parentheses: (3 + -9 + 8 + -4)
To do this, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means we do the addition and subtraction from left to right.

So, (3 + -9) = -6
Then, (-6 + 8) = 2
Finally, (2 + -4) = -2

So, the value of the first parentheses is -2.

Now, let's evaluate the second parentheses: (-4 + -6 - 4 - -8)
Again, following the order of operations, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right.

So, (-4 + -6) = -10
Then, (-10 - 4) = -14
Finally, (-14 - -8) = -14 + 8 = -6

So, the value of the second parentheses is -6.

Now that we have the values of both parentheses, we can substitute them back into the original expression:

((-2) * (-6))
