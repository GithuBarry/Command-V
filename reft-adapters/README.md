# Additional Agreement on Using Jailbreaking Adapters

Responsible research guidelines require restricting distribution of materials with high abuse potential.

**By using the `License ID` in the agreement file as the *decryption password* for the jailbreaking adapters or
jailbroken content, or accessing LLM safety refusal suppression artifacts in this folder by any other means, you certify
that you are a natural person of legal age with capacity to enter into binding agreements, and you agree to be bound by
this Responsible Research Agreement.**

Access constitutes acceptance. Non-compliance constitutes material breach and may result in license termination and
legal action.
